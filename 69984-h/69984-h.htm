		<small>THE YOUNG GIRL ON THE BENCH.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>“And that is your final decision?”</p>

<p>Dick Treadwell gazed sternly at Penelope
Howard’s downcast face, and waited for a
reply.</p>

<p>Instead of answering, as good-mannered
young women generally do, Penelope intently
watched the tips of her russet shoes, as they
appeared and disappeared beneath the edge
of her gown, and remained silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Page 8]</span></p>

<p>When she raised her head and met that
look, so sad and yet so stern, the faintest
shadow of a smile placed a pleasing wrinkle
at the corners of her brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is—my final decision,” she
repeated, slowly.</p>

<p>Dick Treadwell dropped despondently on
a bench and, gazing steadily over the green
lawn, tried to think it all out.</p>

<p>He felt that he was not being used quite
fairly, but he was at a loss for a way to remedy
it.</p>

<p>Here he was, the devoted slave of the
rather plain girl beside him, who refused to
marry him, merely because he had never
soiled his firm, white hands with toil, nor
worried his brain with a greater task, since his
school days, than planning some way to kill
time.</p>

<p>He was one of those unfortunate mortals
possessed of an indolent disposition, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Page 9]</span>
been left a modest legacy, that, though making
him far from wealthy, was still enough to support
him in idleness.</p>

<p>He lacked the spur of necessity which
urged men on to greater deeds.</p>

<p>In short, Richard was one of those worthless
ornaments of society that live, and die
without doing much good or any great harm.</p>

<p>That he was an ornament, however, none
dared to deny, and the expressive brown eyes
of the girl, who had seated herself beside him
bore ample testimony that she was not unconscious
of his manly charms.</p>

<p>Dick took off his straw hat, and after running
his firm, white fingers through his kinky,
light hair, crossed one leg over the other, while
he brooded moodily on his peculiar fate. The
frank, boyish expression, that had won him so
many admirers, was displaced by a heavy
frown, and his bright blue eyes gazed unseeingly
over the beautiful vista before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Page 10]</span></p>

<p>He could not understand why a girl should
get such crazy ideas, any way. There were
plenty of girls who made no effort to hide
their admiration for him, and he knew that
they could be had for the asking, if it only
wasn’t for Penelope.</p>

<p>But, somehow, Penelope had more attraction
for him than any girl he had ever met.
Her very obstinacy, her independence, made
her all the more charming to him, even if it
was provoking.</p>

<p>Penelope Howard was in no wise Dick
Treadwell’s mate in beauty.</p>

<p>She was slender to boniness and tall, but
willowy and graceful, and one forgot her
murky complexion when gazing into the
depths of her bright, expressive eyes and
catching the curve of a wonderfully winsome
smile.</p>

<p>Penelope was an heiress, though, to a million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Page 11]</span>
dollars or more, and so no one ever called
her plain.</p>

<p>She was an orphan and had been reared by
a sensible old aunt, who would doubtless leave
her another million.</p>

<p>Penelope knew her defects as well and better
than did other people. She had no vanity
and was blessed with an unusual amount of
solid sense.</p>

<p>Penelope Howard was well aware that she
would not have to go begging for a husband,
but she had loved handsome Dick Treadwell
ever since the year before she graduated at
Vassar. He had gone there to pay his devotions
to another fair under-graduate and came
away head over heels in love with Penelope.
Nevertheless Penelope was in no hurry to
marry.</p>

<p>She loved Richard with all her heart, but
there was a barrier between them which he
alone could remove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</span></p>

<p>“You know, Dick,” she said, softly, as he
still gazed across the green lawn, trying to
find a mental foothold, as it were, “that I told
you this before”——</p>

<p>“Yes, this makes the sixth time I have
proposed,” he said, savagely, still looking
away.</p>

<p>“I have always told you,” smiling slightly
at his remark and lowering her voice as she
glanced apprehensively at a girl seated on a
bench near by, “that I will not marry you as
long as you live as you do. I have money
enough for two, so it makes no difference
whether the man I marry has any or not. But
I can’t and won’t marry a—a worthless man—one
who has never done anything, and is too
indolent to do anything. I want a husband
who has some ability—who has accomplished
something—just one worthy thing even, and
then—well, it won’t make so much difference
if he is indolent afterwards. You know, Dick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</span>
how much I care for you,” softly, “how fond
I am of you, but I will not marry you until
you prove that you are able to do something.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very easy to talk about,” he replied
savagely, “but what can I do? I don’t
dare risk what little I have in Wall street. I
don’t know enough to preach, or to be a
doctor, or a lawyer, and it takes too infernally
long to go back to the beginning and learn.
You object to my following the races, and I
couldn’t sell ribbons or run a hotel to save me.
Tell me what to do, Penelope, and I will
gladly make the attempt. When you took a—a
craze to walk in the Park at a hideous
hour every morning before your friends, who
don’t think it good form, were out to frown
you down, did I not promise to be your escort,
and haven’t I faithfully got up—or stayed up—to
keep my promise?”</p>

<p>“And only late—let us see how many
times?” she asked roguishly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</span></p>

<p>“Penelope, don’t,” he pleaded. “You
know I love you. Why, Penel’, love, if I
thought that your foolish whim would separate
us forever I’d——Oh, darling, you
don’t doubt my love, do you?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” she whispered, warningly, pointing
to the girl on the other bench.</p>

<p>“Oh, she is asleep,” Dick replied carelessly.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure,” Penelope urged, gazing
abstractedly towards the girl, her eyes soft
with the feeling that was thrilling her heart.</p>

<p>Like all girls Penelope never tired of hearing
the man who had won her love swearing
his devotion, but like all girls she preferred to
be the sole and only listener to those vows, to
that tone.</p>

<p>“If she is awake she is the first young
woman I ever saw who would let her new La
Tosca sunshade lie on the ground,” he said
laughingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</span></p>

<p>“She must be sleeping,” Penelope assented
indifferently, glancing at the parasol lying in
the dust where it had apparently rolled from
the girl’s knee.</p>

<p>Two gray squirrels, with their bushy tails
held stiffly erect, came out on the dusty drive,
and finding everything quiet scampered across
to the green sward, where they stood upright
in the green grass viewing curiously the unhappy
lovers.</p>

<p>Penelope had a mania for carrying peanuts
to the Park to give to the animals. She took
several from her reticule and tossed them towards
the gray squirrels.</p>

<p>The one, with a little whistling noise scampered
up the nearest tree and the other, taking
a nut in his little mouth, quickly followed.</p>

<p>“I have not seen her move since we came
here,” she said, returning to the subject of the
girl. “Do you suppose she put her hat over
her eyes in that manner to keep the light out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Page 16]</span>
of them, or was it done to keep any passers-by
from staring at her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” carelessly. “Probably she
is ill.”</p>

<p>“Ill? Do you think so, Dick? I am going
to speak to her,” declared Penelope, impulsively.</p>

<p>“Don’t, I wouldn’t,” urged Dick.</p>

<p>“But I will,” declared Penelope.</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about her,” he
continued pleadingly. “She may have been out
all night, or you can’t tell but perhaps she has
been drinking too much, and if you wake her
she will doubtless make it unpleasant for you.”</p>

<p>“How uncharitable you are,” indignantly
exclaimed Penelope, who feared no one. She
had spent much time and money in doing
deeds of charity, and she had met all sorts and
conditions of women. That a woman was in
trouble and she could help her, was all Penelope
cared to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Page 17]</span></p>

<p>She got up and walked towards the girl.
Richard, knowing all argument was useless,
went with her. When they stopped, Penelope,
bending down, peeped beneath the brim of the
lace hat which, laden with an abundance of
red roses, was tilted over the motionless girl’s
face.</p>

<p>“She is sleeping,” she whispered softly to
Dick. “Her eyes are closed. She has a lovely
face.”</p>

<p>“Has she, indeed?” and Dick, with increased
interest, bent to look. “She is very
pale and—I am afraid that she is ill,” in an
awed tone. “Young lady!” he called nervously.</p>

<p>The girlish figure never moved. Richard’s
and Penelope’s eyes met with a swift expression—a
mingled look of surprise and fear.</p>

<p>“My dear!” called Penelope, gently shaking
the girl by the shoulder.</p>

<p>The lace hat tumbled off and lay at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Page 18]</span>
feet; the little hands, which had been folded
loosely in her lap, fell apart and the girlish
figure fell lengthwise on the bench.</p>

<p>Breathlessly and silently the frightened
young couple looked at the beautiful upturned
face framed in masses of golden hair;
the blue-rimmed eyes, with their curly dark
lashes resting gently against the colorless
skin; the parted lips in which there lingered a
bit of red.</p>

<p>Nervously Richard touched the cheek of
pallor, and felt for the heart and pulse.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong there?” called a gray-uniformed
officer, who had left his horse near the
edge of the walk.</p>

<p>Penelope silently looked at Richard, waiting
for him to answer, and as he raised his
face all white and horror-stricken, he gasped:</p>

<p>“My God! The girl is dead.”</p>

		<small>PENELOPE SETS A HARD TASK FOR DICK.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>Richard Treadwell was not mistaken.</p>

<p>The golden-haired girl was dead.</p>

<p>The fair young form was taken to the
Morgue, and for some days the newspapers
were filled with accounts of the mystery of
Central Park, and everybody was discussing
the strange case.</p>

<p>And what could have been more mysterious?</p>

<p>A young and exquisitely beautiful girl,
clad in garments stylish and expensive,
although quiet in tone, and such as women of
refinement wear, found dead on a bench in
Central Park by two young people, whose
social position was in those circles where to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Page 20]</span>
brought in any way to public notice is considered
almost a disgrace.</p>

<p>And to add to the mystery of the case the
most thorough examination of the girl’s body
had failed to show the slightest wound or discoloration,
or the faintest clue to the cause of
the girl’s death.</p>

<p>The newspapers had all their own theories.
Some were firm in their belief of foul play,
but they could not even hint at the cause of
death, and how such a lovely creature could
have been murdered, if murder it was, in
Central Park and the assassin or assassins
escape unseen, were riddles they could not
solve.</p>

<p>Other journals hooted at the idea of foul
play. They claimed the girl had, while walking
in Central Park, sat down on the bench,
and died either of heart disease or of poison
administered by her own hand.</p>

<p>The police authorities maintained an air of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Page 21]</span>
impenetrable secrecy, but promised that within
a few days they would furnish some startling
developments. They did not commit themselves,
however, as to their ideas of how the
girl met her death. In this they were wise,
for the silent man is always credited with
knowing a great deal more than the man does
who talks, and so the public waited impatiently
from day to day, confident the police would
soon clear the mystery away.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people visited the Morgue,
curious to look upon the dead girl.</p>

<p>Many went there in search of missing
friends, hoping and yet dreading that in the
mysterious dead girl they would find the one
for whom they searched.</p>

<p>People from afar telegraphed for the body
to be held until their arrival, but they came
and went and the beautiful dead girl was still
unidentified.</p>

<p>Penelope Howard and Richard Treadwell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Page 22]</span>
were made to figure prominently in all the
stories about the beautiful mystery, much to
their discomfort. The untiring reporters
called to see Penelope at all hours, whenever a
fresh theory gave them an excuse to drag her
name before the public again, and poor
Richard had no peace at his club, at his rooms,
or at Penelope’s home. If the reporters were
not interviewing him, his friends were asking
all manner of questions concerning the strange
affair, and pleading repeatedly for the story of
the discovery of the body to be told again.
Some of his club acquaintances even went
so far as to joke him about the girl he had
found dead, and there was much quiet smiling
among his immediate friends at Dick’s fondness
for early walks, a trait first brought to light by
his connection with this now celebrated case.</p>

<p>Not the least important figure in the sensation
was the Park policeman who found
Penelope and Richard bending over the dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Page 23]</span>
girl. He became a very great personage all
at once. The meritorious deeds which
marked his previous record were the finding
of a lost child and the frantically chasing a
stray dog, which he imagined was mad, and
wildly firing at it—very wide of the mark, it is
true—until the poor frightened little thing disappeared
in some remote corner.</p>

<p>This officer became the envy of the Park
policemen. Daily his name appeared in connection
with the case as “the brave officer of
the ‘Mystery of Central Park.’” Daily he
was pointed out by the people, who thronged
to the spot where the girl was found, curious
to see the bench and to carry away with them
some little memento. He always managed to
be near the scene of the mystery during the
busy hours of the Park, and the dignity with
which he answered questions as to the exact
bench, was very impressive.</p>

<p>But the officer’s pride at being connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Page 24]</span>
with such a sensational case was not to be
wondered at.</p>

<p>Rarely had New York been so stirred to
its depth over a mysterious death. The newspapers
published the most minute descriptions
of the dead girl’s dainty silk underwear, of
her exquisitely made Directoire dress, of her
Suéde shoes, the silver handled La Tosca sunshade,
and more particularly did they dwell on
descriptions of her dainty feet and tiny hands,
of her perfect features and masses of beautiful
yellow hair.</p>

<p>There was every indication of refinement
and luxury about her.</p>

<p>How came it, then, that a being of such
beauty and grace could have no one who
missed her; could have no one to search
frantically the wide world for her?</p>

<p>The day of the inquest came.</p>

<p>Penelope, accompanied by her aunt and
Richard, were forced to be present. Penelope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Page 25]</span>
in a very steady voice told how they found the
body, and she was questioned and cross-questioned
as to the reason why she should
have become so interested in the sight of an
apparently sleeping girl as to accost her.</p>

<p>It was a most unusual thing.</p>

<p>Did she not think that it had been suggested
by the young man who accompanied
her?</p>

<p>Penelope’s cheeks burned and she became
very indignant at their efforts to connect
Richard more closely with the case, and she
related all that had transpired after they spoke
of the girl with such minuteness and ease,
that it was hinted afterwards that she had
studied the story in order to protect the
culprit.</p>

<p>Poor Richard came next.</p>

<p>His story did not differ from Penelope’s,
and while no one said in so many words
that they suspected him of knowing more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Page 26]</span>
than he divulged, yet he felt their suspicions
and accusations in every question and every
look.</p>

<p>A very knowing newspaper had that same
morning published a long story, relating instances
where murderers could not remain
away from their victims, and always returned
to the spot, in many cases pretending to be
the discoverer of the murder. The story
finished by demanding that the authorities decide
at the inquest whose hand was in the
murder of the beautiful young girl.</p>

<p>Dick, remembering all this, felt his heart
swell with indignation at the tones of his examiner.</p>

<p>Penelope was more indignant, if anything,
than Dick, but she had read in a newspaper
that repudiated the theory of murder, a collection
of accounts of deaths which had been
thought suspicious that were afterwards
proven to be the result of heart disease or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Page 27]</span>
poison, and she quietly hoped that the doctors
who held the post-mortem examination
would set at rest all the doubts in the case.</p>

<p>The park policeman, in a grandiloquent
manner, gave his testimony.</p>

<p>He told how he found the young couple
bending over the dead girl, who was half lying
on a bench. When the officer asked what was
wrong, the young man, who seemed excited
and frightened—and he laid great stress on
those words—replied “The girl is dead.” The
officer had then looked at the body but did not
touch it. The young people denied any
knowledge of the girl’s identity, and then his
suspicions being aroused he asked the young
man why he had replied “The girl is dead,” if
he did not know her?</p>

<p>The young man repeated that he had
never seen the dead girl before, and his companion
gave him a quick, frightened glance; so
the officer said sternly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Page 28]</span></p>

<p>“Be careful, young man, remember you
are talking to the law; I’ll have to report
everything you say.”</p>

<p>And then the officer paused to take breath
and at the same time to give proper weight to
his words. Everybody took the opportunity
to remove their gaze from the officer and to
see how Dick Treadwell was bearing it. They
were getting more interested now and nearly
everyone felt that the elegant young man
would be in the clutches of the law by the
time the inquest was adjourned.</p>

<p>The officer cleared his throat and in a
deep, gruff voice continued his story.</p>

<p>At his warning the young man had flushed
very red, then paled, and then he called the
officer a fool.</p>

<p>Still the conscientious limb of the law determined
to know more about two young people,
who, while able to drive, were doing such
unusual and extraordinary things as walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Page 29]</span>
early in the Park and happening upon the dead
body of a young girl; so he asked the young
man why, if he did not know the girl, he did
not say “<em>a</em> girl is dead here,” instead of “<em>the</em>
girl is dead,” whereupon the young man told
the officer again that he was a fool, adding several
words to make it more emphatic, and at
this the young girl, who stood by very gravely
up to this time, had the boldness and impudence
to laugh.</p>

<p>Richard Treadwell was called again, and
had to repeat the reason of his early walk in
the Park, and had to tell where he spent the
previous evening, which was proven by Penelope
and her aunt. He was questioned why
he used the definite article instead of the indefinite
in answering the officer’s question.
He could offer no explanation.</p>

<p>That a man should say “<em>the</em> girl” instead
of “<em>a</em> girl,” and that he should be excited over
finding the body of a girl unknown to him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Page 30]</span>
were things that looked very suspicious to the
law, and those in charge of the inquest had no
hesitancy in showing the fact.</p>

<p>A few persons whose testimony was unimportant
were called, and then came the doctors
who had made the post-mortem examination.
Nothing was discovered to indicate
murder or suicide, nor, indeed, could they
come to any definite conclusion as to the cause
of death.</p>

<p>The coroner’s jury brought in an indefinite
verdict, showing that they knew no more
about the circumstances or cause of the girl’s
death than they did at the beginning of the
inquest. With this unsatisfactory conclusion
the public was forced to rest content.</p>

<p>They did know that the girl had not been
shot or stabbed, which was some satisfaction,
at any rate.</p>

<p>Penelope persuaded her aunt and Richard
to accompany her through the Morgue. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Page 31]</span>
was deeply hurt at the way in which Dick had
been treated. Still she wanted to look on
the face of the fair young girl, the cause of all
the worriment, before she was taken to her
grave.</p>

<p>“How dreadful!” exclaimed Penelope’s
aunt, as the keeper unbolted the door and
waited, before he closed it, for them to enter
the low room.</p>

<p>She tiptoed daintily over the stone floor—which,
wet all over, had little streams formed
in places flowing from different hose—holding
her skirts up with one hand, and with the
other hand held a perfumed handkerchief over
her aristocratic nose. Penelope, with serious
but calm face, kept close to the keeper, and
Richard walked silently with the aunt.</p>

<p>“I thought the bodies lay on marble slabs,”
said Penelope, glancing at the row of plain,
unpainted rough boxes set close together on
iron supports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Page 32]</span></p>

<p>“They did in the old Morgue, but ever
since we’ve been in this building we put them
in the boxes. They keep better this way,”
explained the keeper, delighted to show the
sights of the Morgue to persons of social
prominence.</p>

<p>“Do you know the history of all these
dead?” asked Penelope, counting the fifty and
odd coffins which came one after the other.</p>

<p>“We know somethin’ about most all ’cept
those found in the river, and the river furnishes
more bodies than the whole city do. We
photograph every body and we pack their
clothes away, with a description of ’em, and
keep them six months. The photographs we
always keep, so that years after people may
find their lost here. Would you like to see
them, miss?”</p>

<p>“You see,” continued the man, lifting a
lid, “we burn a cross on the coffins of the
Catholics, and the Protestants get no mark.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Page 33]</span>
The boxes with the chalk mark on are the
ones that’s to be buried to-morrow. This man
here, miss,” holding the lid up, “was a street-car
driver; want to see him, mam?”</p>

<p>Penelope’s aunt shook her head negatively.</p>

<p>“He struck, and could not get work afterwards,
so as he and his family was starvin’, he
made them one less by committing suicide.”</p>

<p>“It is so hard to die,” Penelope said with
a shudder.</p>

<p>“Hard? Not a bit, miss; death’s a great
boon to poor people. This ’ere fellow,” holding
another lid while Penelope gazed with dry,
burning eyes down on a weather-beaten face,
which, seared with a million premature
wrinkles, wore a smile of rest, “he was a
tramp, they ’spose. Fell dead on Sixth
Avenue, an’ he had nothin’ on him to identify
him. And this ’ere woman who lies next the
Park mystery girl, though she do smile like
she got somethin’ she wanted—an’ they nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Page 34]</span>
all smile, miss, when they’ve handed in their
’counts—she were a devil. She’s done time on
the island, and they’ve had her in Blackwell’s
Insane Asylum, but ’twan’t no good; soon as
she got out she was at her old tricks. Drink,
drink, if she had to steal it, an’ fight an’
swear! They picked her up on a sidewalk the
last time and hauled her to the station-house,
but when mornin’ come an’ they called her she
didn’t show up; an’ when they dragged her
out, thinkin’ she was still full, they found she’d
got a death sentence and gone on a last trip to
the island where they never come back.”</p>

<p>A little woman, stumpy, fat and old, in
a shabby black frock and plain black bonnet,
came in with one of the keeper’s assistants.
She held a coarse white cotton handkerchief in
her hand, and her wrinkled, broad face with its
fish-like mouth, thick, upturned nose and
watery blue eyes, looked prepared to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Page 35]</span>
evidence of grief when the search among the
labelled rough-boxes was successful.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lang,” read the man who was
assisting the woman in her search, “from the
Almshouse?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that was her name, true enough.
The Lord rest her soul!” the woman responded
fervently, and the man slid the lid
across the box, and the little old woman, holding
the handkerchief over her stubby nose,
peeped in.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s her; that’s Mrs. Lang. Poor
thing! Ah! she do look desolate,” she
wailed. “She hasn’t a fri’nd in all the world,”
she continued, looking with her weak eyes at
Penelope, who sympathetically stopped by her.
“She was eighty years old, and paralyzed from
her knees down. Poor thing, they took her to
the Almshouse not quite a month ago, and she
looks like she’d had a hard time, sure enough.
Poor Mrs. Lang, she do look desolate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Page 36]</span></p>

<p>The man closed the box as if he had given
her time enough to weep, and the wailing
woman went out.</p>

<p>“What becomes of the bodies of these
poor unfortunates?” asked Penelope, with a
catch in her voice.</p>

<p>“Most of ’em we give to the medical colleges
as subjects. Yes, men and women,
black and white alike. That nigger woman,
who wouldn’t tell on the man who gave her a
death stab, lying to the other side of the Park
mystery girl, will be taken to a college to-night.
The bodies not sold are all sent up to Hart’s
Island, where they’re buried in a big trench.”</p>

<p>Penelope’s sympathetic nature quivered with
pity by reason of what she had seen and
heard. She secretly resolved to give the
poor unknown girl a respectable burial, and to
order some flowers to be strewed in the rough-boxes
with the other unfortunates who would
be taken to the Potter’s Field to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Page 37]</span></p>

<p>“Death is a horrible thing,” she remarked
sadly, as they filed through the iron doors
again.</p>

<p>“It is, miss,” the keeper assented. “I’ve
had charge of this here Morgue for these
twenty years, still if I was to allow myself to
think about death and the mystery of the hereafter,
I’d go crazy.”</p>

<p>“But the thought of Heaven. It is surely
some consolation,” faltered Penelope.</p>

<p>“Twenty years’ work in there,” nodding
his head towards the throne where death sits
always; where the only noise is the sound of
the dripping water; “hasn’t left any fairy tales
in my mind about what comes after. We live,
and when we’re dead that’s the last of it. You
can tell children about the ‘good man’ and
‘bad man’ and Heaven and—beggin’ your pardon—Hell,
just the same as you tell them
about Santa Claus, but when they grow up if
they thinks for themselves they know its fairy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Page 38]</span>
tales—all fairy tales. When you’re dead,
you’re dead, and that’s the last of it, take my
word for that.”</p>

<p>Penelope was not a religious fanatic, but
her few pious beliefs experienced a little resentful
shock at the man’s outspoken words.
She haughtily drew her shoulders up, the kind
expression faded from her face, leaving it less
attractive, and she was conscious of a little
feeling of repulsion for the unbelieving
Morgue keeper. Not that the keeper’s ideas
were so foreign to those that had visited her
own mind. She had many times felt dubious
on such subjects herself, but she had always
felt it to be her duty to kill doubt and trust in
that which was taught her concerning the life
hereafter.</p>

<p>Penelope joined her aunt and Richard
Treadwell, where they stood under a shade
tree opposite the Morgue waiting her.</p>

<p>In a few words she told what she wished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Page 39]</span>
to do. Her kind aunt good naturedly encouraged
her. Perhaps what they had seen
had had a softening effect on her as well.</p>

<p>Instead of driving home they drove to the
coroner’s, and with the permit which they
obtained without difficulty, to an undertaker’s,
where the final arrangements were made for
the girl’s burial.</p>

<p>So the beautiful mystery of Central Park
was not sent to a medical college nor to the
Potter’s Field. The next morning Penelope
accompanied Richard in his coupé, and Mrs.
Louise Van Brunt, her aunt, who had in her
carriage two charitable old lady friends, followed
the sombre hearse in its slow journey
across the bridge to Brooklyn. In a quiet
graveyard on the outskirts of the city the dead
girl was lowered into the earth.</p>

<p>Penelope was greatly wrought up over the
case. All the way to the graveyard she was
moody and silent. Seeing that she was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Page 40]</span>
inclined to talk, Richard too sat silent and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>Added to her interest in the dead girl, the
evident suspicions entertained against Richard
had preyed upon Penelope’s mind. While
she never doubted Richard’s innocence in the
affair, still ugly thoughts concerning his careless
nature, and the recalled rumors of affairs
with actresses, of more or less renown, which
the newspapers darkly hinted at, almost set her
wild. Could it be possible that he had known
the girl, or ever seen her before they found
her dead?</p>

<p>She recalled his excitement when he leaned
down and for the first time saw the face of the
girl as she sat on the bench. The officer had
laid great stress on Dick’s excited manner, and
to Penelope, as she looked back, it seemed
suggestive of more than he had acknowledged.</p>

<p>“And I love him, I love him,” she cried to
herself during the long ride to the cemetery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Page 41]</span>
“and with this horrible suspicion hanging over
him I could never marry him; I could never
be happy if I did. I can never be happy if I
don’t. If we only knew something about it; if
only people did not hint things; if I could only
crush the horrible idea that he knows more
than he told!”</p>

<p>They dismounted, after driving into the
cemetery, and walked silently across the
green; winding in and out among the grassy
and flowered beds and white stones which
marked all that had once been life—hope.</p>

<p>An unknown but Christian minister stood
waiting them at the open grave. Penelope
glanced at him and at the workmen, who left
the shade of a tree near-by when they saw the
party approaching, and came forward with
faces void of any feeling but that of impudent
curiosity. The minister repeated the burial
service very softly, as the coffin was lowered
into the earth. Penelope’s throat felt bursting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Page 42]</span>
and her heart beat painfully as Richard, with
strangely solemn face, dropped some flowers
into the grave.</p>

<p>“Oh death? How horrible, how horrible!”
she thought, “and I, too, some day must die;
must be put in a grave, and then—and then,
what? What have we done to our Creator
that we must die? And that poor girl! This
is the last for all eternity, and there is not one
here she knew to see the last, unless”——but
the morbid thought against Richard refused to
form itself into definite shape.</p>

<p>The men who filled the grave were the
most light-hearted in the group. They pulled
up a board, and the pile of fresh earth at the
mouth of the grave, which it had upheld,
went rattling in on the coffin and flowers,
almost gladly it seemed to Penelope. She
shivered slightly, but watched as if fascinated,
until the men put on the last shovel-full and
with a spade deftly shaped out the mound.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Page 43]</span>
Richard helped her cover the newly-made
grave with the flowers and green ivy and
smilax they had brought for that purpose.</p>

<p>They were the last to leave. The others
had walked slowly among the graves and back
to the place where the carriages were waiting.
The hearse, immediately after the coffin was
lowered into the earth, had gone off with rollicking
speed, as if eager for new freight, and
the workmen with their spades and picks had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“It is ended,” said Dick with a relieved
sigh, as he led Penelope back to her carriage.
“Now let us forget all the misery of these last
few days and be happy.”</p>

<p>“It is not ended,” exclaimed Penelope,
spiritedly. “It has only begun. I can never
be happy until I know the secret of that girl’s
death.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible, Penelope,” replied
Dick. “That mystery can never be solved.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Page 44]</span></p>

<p>“Dick, you have sworn you love me; you
have sworn that you would do anything I
asked if I would marry you. Did you mean
it? Will you swear it again?” cried Penelope,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Mean it, love?” repeated Dick, as he
pressed her hand closely between his arm and
heart. “Upon my life, I swear it.”</p>

		CHAPTER III.<br>
		<small>WHEREIN DICK TREADWELL MEETS WITH ANOTHER ADVENTURE.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>Richard Treadwell was in despair.</p>

<p>Days had passed since the burial of the
unknown girl, and he was no nearer the solution
of the mystery than he was on the morning
of the discovery. He had not learned one
new thing in the case, and what was infinitely
worse, he had not the least idea how to set
about the task.</p>

<p>He had taken to wandering restlessly about
the city racked with the wildest despondency.</p>

<p>“Great Lord, if I only had an idea,” he
thought, desperately, as he walked up Fifth
Avenue. “If I only knew how to begin—if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Page 46]</span>
only knew where to begin—if I only knew
what to do—if I only—Confound the girl,
anyhow. Why couldn’t she have died somewhere
else, or why didn’t some one else find
her instead of us. Confound it, I’ll be hanged
if I hadn’t enough to worry about before.
Women will take the most infernal whims.
Good Lord! If I wasn’t suspected of being
connected with her death, and if Penelope——But
I’ll be d—— if I can give it the go-by.
It’s solve the mystery or lose Penelope! If I
only knew how to go to work. But, by Jove,
I know I could preach a sermon, or set a
broken leg, or—or cook a dinner easier than
find out why, where, when, how, that yellow-haired
girl died. Curse my luck, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“I have read stories where fellows who
don’t know much start out to solve murder
mysteries, but they always find something
which all the detectives and police authorities
overlooked, which gives them the right clue to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Page 47]</span>
work on. It’s very good for tales, but I find
nothing. The rest are just as smart and
smarter at finding clues than I am. They got
nothing. I got nothing, and what to do
would puzzle a Solomon.”</p>

<p>Dick stopped and looked up to the
windows of Penelope’s home, where his
wandering feet had brought him. He had not
seen her for two days; so busy on the case, he
wrote her with a groan, and then he had sent
her a bunch of roses, and gone forth to kill
another day in aimless wanderings.</p>

<p>But here, before her door—how could a
lover resist the temptation to enter and be
happy in the presence of his divinity for a few
moments at least? Richard was not one of
the resisting kind any way, so, after a moment’s
thought, he ran up the broad stone
steps and was ushered into Penelope’s room
off the library—half sitting-room, half study—to
wait for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Page 48]</span></p>

<p>Nothing was wanting in Penelope’s special
den, that luxury could suggest, to make it an
exquisite retreat for a young woman with a
taste for the beautiful. There were heavy
portieres, soft, rich carpet, handsome rugs
here and there on the floor and thrown carelessly
over low divans. Chairs and lounges of
different shapes, all made for comfort, little
tables strewed with rich bric-a-brac, unique
spirit lamps, and on easels and hanging around
were paintings and etchings, all of which, as
Penelope said, had a story in them.</p>

<p>There were some fine statues, among which
were several the work of Penelope. A little
low organ, with a piano lamp near it, stood
open and there were music and books in profusion.</p>

<p>Near where the daylight came strongest
was a sensible flat-top desk littered with paper,
cards, books and the thousand little trinkets—useless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Page 49]</span>
if you please—which a refined woman
gathers about to please her eye.</p>

<p>The most unusual things that would have
impressed a stranger, if by some unknown
chance he could gain admittance here, was a
mixed collection of odd canes and weapons,
and a skull in the centre of the desk, which
was utilized as an inkstand and a penholder.</p>

<p>“Why, Dick,” said Penelope, as she
tripped lightly in, clad in an artistic gray
carriage gown. “I am glad to see you. I
wish you had been earlier so you could have
enjoyed a drive with aunt and me.”</p>

<p>“I have been busy,” Richard said bravely,
releasing the hand she had given him on entering.</p>

<p>They sat down together on a sofa.</p>

<p>“I have been so occupied that I haven’t
had time for a drive these last few days.”</p>

<p>“And have you discovered anything yet?”
Penelope asked, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Page 50]</span></p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” hesitatingly, “it will
take time to clear it all up, you know.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, do you know her name yet, and
where she came from, and was she really
murdered?”</p>

<p>“Slowly, slowly; would you have me spoil
my luck by telling what I have done?” asked
Richard evasively, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“Oh, you superstitious boy,” laughed Penelope,
lightly tapping him with her hand,
which he immediately caught and held captive
in his own.</p>

<p>“Don’t be unkind,” he pleaded, as she
tried to draw her hand away.</p>

<p>“Not for worlds,” she replied gravely, ceasing
to struggle. “Mr. John Stetson Maxwell
called here last night, and he told me of an experience
he had when he was an editor, that
made me resolve never to speak or act unkindly
if I can help it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Page 51]</span></p>

<p>“I am deeply obliged to Mr. Maxwell,”
Richard responded lightly.</p>

<p>“But it was very sad, Dick. I felt unhappy
all the evening over it.”</p>

<p>“I wish my miseries and wretchedness
could have the same influence on you,” he
broke in with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to hear the story? I had
intended to tell it to you,” she said, half provoked
at his lack of seriousness.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly. By all means,” he replied,
grave enough now. He never joked
when she assumed that tone and look.</p>

<p>“When he was an editor,” she began softly,
“he one day received a very bright poem from
a man in Buffalo. He did not know the man
as a writer, still the poem was so meritorious
that he straightway accepted it, and sent a
note to the author enclosing a check for the
work. A few days afterwards, the man’s card
was sent in, with a request for an interview.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Page 52]</span>
Mr. Maxwell was very busy at the time, but he
thought he would give the man a moment,
so he told the boy to bring the visitor up.
When he came in, Mr. Maxwell was surprised
to see a young man of some twenty-five
years. He was not well clad, and was much
abashed when he found himself in the presence
of such a great personage as the editor,
Mr. Maxwell.”</p>

<p>“Rightly, rightly,” Richard said, good
naturedly, patting her hands encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Maxwell recalled afterwards that
the young man looked in wretched spirits,”
Penelope continued, with a slow smile. “At
the time he was too hurried to notice anything,
and then editors are used to seeing
people who are in ill-luck. He brusquely
asked the young man his business, seeing
that he made no effort to tell it, and then
the young man said he had come to the city
and thought he would like to look around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Page 53]</span>
the office. Mr. Maxwell rang for a boy, and
telling him to show the young man about,
shortly dismissed him. In a few days after
he received a batch of poetry from the
young man, but though of remarkable merit,
Mr. Maxwell thought it too sombre in tone
for his publication, so he enclosed it with
one of the printed slips used for rejected
manuscripts. In a day or so Mr. Maxwell
was shocked to read of the young man’s
death. He had gone out to the park, and
sitting down on a bench, beside the lake,
put a revolver to his ear and so killed himself.
He fell off the bench and into the lake,
and his body was not found until the next
day. He had a letter in his pocket requesting
that his body be cremated. He left
enough money to pay the expenses, and word
for one of his friends that he could do as he
wished with his ashes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Page 54]</span></p>

<p>“Well, many people do the same thing,”
Richard said, rather unfeelingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, but this case was particularly sad,”
Penelope asserted. “The young man was all
alone. He hadn’t a relative in the world. He
had fought his way up and had just completed
his law studies, but had not, as yet, succeeded
in obtaining any practice. He was in distress
and Mr. Maxwell thinks, as I do, that he was
so encouraged when his poem was accepted
that he came to the city with the purpose of
asking employment of the editor, but being
greeted so coldly and roughly, I think he
could not tell the object of his visit. On his
return to Buffalo, as a last hope, he wrote some
poetry which was colored with his own despondent
feelings, and when they were all
returned to him it was the last straw—he went
out and shot himself.”</p>

<p>“But what else could Mr. Maxwell have
done, Penelope,” Richard asked, in a business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Page 55]</span>
way. “He could not accept work, and pay for
it, that was not suitable for his periodical. I
don’t see how he could reproach himself in
that case.”</p>

<p>“I do and so does he,” she replied stoutly.
“It wouldn’t have taken any more time to be
kind to that man than it took to be unkind to
him, and when he rejected the poetry, instead
of sending back that brutal printed notice he
could have had his stenographer write a line,
saying the poetry, though meritorious, was not
suitable for his journal. That would, at least,
have eased the disappointment.”</p>

<p>“But editors haven’t time for such things,
Penelope.”</p>

<p>“Then let them take time. I tell you it
takes less time to be kind than to be unkind,”
she maintained, nodding her head positively.</p>

<p>“If they were not short, bores would occupy
all their time,” he persisted.</p>

<p>“Richard, we will not argue the case,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Page 56]</span>
said loftily, as a woman always does when she
feels she is being worsted. “You can’t make
me think anything will excuse a man for being
brutal and unkind.”</p>

<p>Richard had his own opinion on the subject,
but he was wise enough to refrain from trying
to make Penelope have a similar one.</p>

<p>“I am going away,” she said, presently,
finding that Dick was not averse to dropping
the discussion. “Auntie has accepted an invitation
to go to Washington for a few days to
visit Mrs. Senator ——, and I am to go along.
I rather dread it, but auntie says they won’t
know as much about the Park mystery there,
and I won’t be worried with reporters.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” replied Dick, beginning already
to feel the ghastly emptiness which pervaded
the city for him when Penelope was not
in it. As long as he knew Penelope was in the
city, even if he did not see her, he had a certain
happiness of nearness, but when she was away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Page 57]</span>
he felt as desolate as Adam must have done
before Eve came.</p>

<p>“Penelope, girlie,” he said, with a sudden
hope, “could we not be engaged while I am
working on this case? It would not embarrass
you in any way, for we only need tell
your aunt, and it would be such help, such
encouragement, such happiness, sweet to me.
You see it may take months to solve this mystery.”
Poor Richard thought it would take
years. “And if I only knew, darling, that I
had your promise, I could do so much. It
would help me to conquer the world. Don’t
be hard-hearted, dear; don’t be cruel to the
one who loves you more than anything on
earth or in heaven.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Dick, you must wait,” said Penelope.
“Wait until the mystery is solved, it
shouldn’t take you a great while”—(Richard
sighed)—“and then, and then—”</p>

<p>“Then?” repeated Dick, questioningly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Page 58]</span>
She looked down with sudden embarrassment;
he put his arms around her slender waist and
drew her close to him. “Then? my love, my
soul!”—</p>

<p>“Dearest, come here!” called Penelope’s
aunt, in that well-bred voice of hers which
charmed all hearers, but at this particular
moment was very exasperating to Dick.
“Richard, come, I want you to see the man
standing on the other side of the Avenue. I
have been watching him and I think it is quite
probable that he is watching the house. Are
we never to have done with that Park mystery
business?”</p>

<p>They all looked cautiously through the
curtains, and they all agreed that the man was
watching the house for some purpose.</p>

<p>“They are after you, Dick,” exclaimed
Penelope. “Oh, I am so afraid this will result
seriously to you.”</p>

<p>Richard thought so too, only where she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Page 59]</span>
was concerned, though; but he did not give
voice to his fears.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” laughed the aunt, with
that pleasant ring. “Do not talk such nonsense!
Richard is able to take care of himself,
and especially now that he knows some
one is following him.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Dick took his leave of
Penelope. She maintained an air of cheerfulness
as he said farewell, but though the mouth
was merry, the sad eyes which met his seemed
to whisper the nearness of tears.</p>

<p>Catching up his walking-stick, Richard
hastily left the house. He was feeling so blue
that he was almost savage. He thought of
the man who had been watching the house,
and he looked to see if he was still there, half
tempted to hunt the fellow out and pull his
nose.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the man was there and, as
Richard started down the Avenue, he sneaked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Page 60]</span>
along on the other side, much after the manner
of a disobedient dog who had been told to stay
at home. Dick hailed a passing stage, after
walking a little way, and almost as soon as he
was seated the man also got in. Richard was
not in a mood to bear watching, so he jumped
out when he saw an empty hansom cab, and,
engaging it, told the driver to cross town.
He did not drive far until he had made sure
that he had eluded his would-be follower, and
having no appetite yet for dinner he ordered
the driver to go to Central Park, where he
paid and dismissed him.</p>

<p>Now that he was alone, he became conscious
of a desire to visit the scene of the
mystery which promised to be so fatal to his
happiness.</p>

<p>“I’ll go there and think it over,” he mused;
“it may give me some idea how to work it
out.” And on he walked over the course he
and Penelope had taken that direful morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Page 61]</span></p>

<p>Night was coming on and the Park was deserted,
except for an occasional workman
taking a hurried cut across the Park home.
How dreary and quiet everything was, and
then he thought about the officer who had
made himself so obnoxious. This led him to
wonder if there were no policemen on duty at
night in the Park. He could not remember
of ever having noticed any the few times he
had visited the Park after nightfall, and there
were none visible now anywhere.</p>

<p>He stopped to look for a few moments at
the bench where they had found the dead girl,
and then he walked on until he came to a
bench near the reservoir, where he sat down,
and lighting a cigarette gave himself up to unhappy
thoughts on his unhappy position.</p>

<p>“If only the Fates would throw something
in my way to help me solve that mystery,” he
thought. “Unless the most extraordinary
things occur I shall never be able to tell anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Page 62]</span>
about it. Penelope firmly believes it
was a murder, but I can’t see what grounds she
has for it. She thinks it was a deliberate and
well-planned murder, because no one has
claimed the girl, and I sometimes think so myself,
but how to prove it?—that’s the question.”</p>

<p>And Dick gazed seriously at the space of
light made by the opening for the reservoir,
and on to the dense thickness of trees where
night seemed to be lurking, ready to pounce
down on all late comers.</p>

<p>As he looked he became aware of something
moving between him and the spot of
light. He was a brave young man, yet his
heart beat a little quicker as he strained his
eyes to see what the moving object was.</p>

<p>Again it passed in view, and this time it
looked to be something climbing; another
moment and it was on the edge of the reservoir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Page 63]</span></p>

<p>Now, plainly outlined between him and the
strip of light sky, he saw the figure of a
woman, a slender girl with flowing hair.</p>

<p>Quick as a flash came the horrible thought
that she had come there to die—that she intended
to commit suicide.</p>

<p>With a choking cry of horror he ran
swiftly towards her.</p>

		CHAPTER IV.<br>
		<small>STORY OF THE GIRL WHO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>Richard Treadwell sat moodily on a bench,
half supporting the limp form of the girl he
had just saved from death.</p>

<p>He had caught her just as she threw up
her hands with a pitiful, weak cry, ready to
spring into the reservoir.</p>

<p>“My dear young woman, don’t take on so,”
he said, vexedly, as the girl leaned against his
shoulder, and sobbed in a heart-broken, distracted
manner. “You are safe now.”</p>

<p>As if that could be consolation to a
woman who was seeking death which sought
her not.</p>

<p>“Really, I am sorry, you know, but there’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Page 65]</span>
a good girl, don’t cry,” making a ludicrous
attempt to console her. “I did it before I
thought; if I had known how much you
would have been grieved, I—I assure you,
upon my honor, I wouldn’t have done it.
I—I haven’t much to live for, either, still
when I saw what you intended to do—it
shocked me that you should be so desperate.
Now that it’s all over I wouldn’t cry any more.
I’d laugh, as if it were a joke, you know. I’d
say the fates had saved me for some treat they
had reserved for me. There, that’s better,
don’t cry, you are not hurt—not even wet.”</p>

<p>The girl broke into a nervous, hysterical
laugh, in which the sobs struggled for mastery.
Dick, much relieved, added a laugh that
sounded rather hollow and mirthless.</p>

<p>“I c-can’t help it,” said she, haltingly and
endeavoring to stop her sobs. “It seems so
unreal to be still living when I wanted to be
dead. I—I thought it all over, and it seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Page 66]</span>
so comforting to think of it being ended.
Then I couldn’t see, nor think, nor hear, nor
suffer. Oh, why did you stop me?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know, you see; I didn’t understand
it all. I thought you would regret it—that
you were making a mistake,” he tried to
say cheerfully.</p>

<p>“What right has anybody—what right had
you to prevent me from ending my life? I
don’t want to live! I am tired of life and of
misery. I want to know what right any one
has to interfere—to make me live a life that
doesn’t concern them and only brings me
misery?” she cried, indignantly.</p>

<p>“Come now, don’t be so cast down.” At
this burst of anger Richard was himself again.
“Tell me all about it; maybe I can help you.
Have things gone wrong?”</p>

<p>“Have they ever gone right? Don’t
preach to me. It’s easy to preach to people
who have friends and money and home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Page 67]</span>
Save your sermons for them. I have nothing!
I am all alone in this great big heartless
world. I haven’t a cent, a home or a friend,
and I’m tired of it all. There is no use in
talking to me. Some people get it all, and
the others get nothing. I am one of the
unlucky ones, and the only thing for me to do
is to die.”</p>

<p>“Why, my good girl, there is surely something
better for you than death.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing but trouble and hunger,
and sometimes work. Do you call that better
than death?” she cried despondently.</p>

<p>What a story her few words contained!
But Richard, happy, careless, fortunate, little
understood their real import.</p>

<p>He knew the girl was very much depressed
and morbid, so he concluded it might have a
beneficial effect if he could induce her to relate
her woes to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Page 68]</span></p>

<p>How mountainous our troubles grow when
we brood over them.</p>

<p>How they dwindle into little ant-heaps
when we relate them to another.</p>

<p>Richard talked in his frank, healthy way to
the girl, and it was not long until she told him
the simple, pathetic story of her life.</p>

<p>Her name was Dido Morgan, she said.
She was a country girl, the only child of a village
doctor, who lived in comfort but died
penniless. Her mother died at her birth.
She had been raised well, and when reduced
to poverty she was too proud to go to work in
her native village, so after her father was
buried she came to New York.</p>

<p>She soon found that without experience
and references she could not get any desirable
work in New York. When all other things
failed, she, at last, in desperation, applied for
and obtained a position in a paper-box factory.
She was fortunate enough to learn the work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Page 69]</span>
rapidly, and in a few months was able to earn
as much as the best workers. She rented a
little room on the top floor of a large tenement-house,
where she slept and cooked her
food. Every week she managed to save a
little out of her scant earnings.</p>

<p>One day a girl who worked at the same
table with Dido, and who had for a long time
been her friend, fainted. The girls crowded
around them as Dido knelt on the floor to
bathe the sick girl’s head and rub her hands.</p>

<p>“Aha! Away from yer tables durin’ work
hours. I’ll pay yer fer this, I’ll dock every
one of you,” yelled the foreman, who at this
instant entered the workroom.</p>

<p>The girls, frightened, crept quietly back to
their work, but Dido still continued to bathe
the girl’s head.</p>

<p>“Here, you daisy on the floor, you’ll disobey
me, hey? I’ll dock yer twice,” brutally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Page 70]</span>
spoke the foreman as he caught a glimpse of
Dido’s head across the table.</p>

<p>She looked at him with scorn. If glances
could kill, he would have died at her feet.
Still, she managed to say, quietly:</p>

<p>“Maggie Williams has fainted.”</p>

<p>“And because a girl faints must all the
shop stop work and disobey rules, eh? I’ll
pay yer for this. I’ll teach yer,” he vowed, as
he quitted the room.</p>

<p>Dido, unmindful of his brutal threats,
turned her attention to Maggie, who in a short
time opened her eyes and tried to rise.</p>

<p>“Lie still awhile yet, Maggie,” urged her
self-appointed nurse. “I’ll hold your head on
my knee. Don’t you feel better now?”</p>

<p>But the girl made no reply. Her small
gray eyes stared unblinkingly, unseeingly, up
at the smoked rafters of the ceiling.</p>

<p>“What is it, Maggie?” asked the kindly
Dido, smoothing the wet, tangled hair, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Page 71]</span>
slender fingers expressing the sympathy which
found no utterance in words. “Are you still
ill? Shall I take you home to your mother?”</p>

<p>The stare in the small gray eyes grew
softer and softer; the corners of the mouth
drew down into a pitiful curve, the under lip
quivering like a tiny leaf in a strong wind;
turning her face down, she sobbed vehemently.</p>

<p>Drawing the poor thin body into a closer
embrace, Dido sought to comfort the weeping
girl.</p>

<p>Some of the nearest workers hearing those
low, heavy sobs, started nervously, and their
hands were not as cunning as usual as they
covered the boxes, but they dared not go near
their unhappy companion or speak the sympathy
they felt.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Maggie,” whispered
Dido, “don’t cry so; you’ll feel better by-and-by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Page 72]</span></p>

<p>“Mother’s dead,” blurted out Maggie.</p>

<p>Dido was stunned into silence by this communication.
She could say nothing.</p>

<p>What could you say to a girl when her
mother is dead?</p>

<p>What could console a girl at such a time?</p>

<p>Maggie told Dido that the dead body of
her mother, who, for a year past, had been
confined to her bed with consumption, was
lying alone, uncared for, at home.</p>

<p>“I loved her so, and I didn’t want her to
die,” she said pitifully. “I was afraid to go
home after work for fear I’d find her dead, and
I was afraid to sleep at night for fear she’d be
dead when I woke up. She lay so still, and
she looked so white and death-like, and I
would lean on my elbow and watch her, fearing
her breath would stop. Every few moments
I prayed, ‘O God, save her!’ ‘O God,
have mercy!’ I—I couldn’t say more, and I
would swallow down the thing that would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Page 73]</span>
choke my throat and wink away the tears that
would come, and watch and watch, until I
couldn’t bear the doubt any longer, then I
would touch her gently with my foot to see if
she was still warm, and that would wake her,
and I would be so sorry.</p>

<p>“All last night I never took my eyes off
her dear face,” Maggie continued between her
sobs, and Dido was softly crying, too, then.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t eat the things I had brought
her, and when I talked to her she didn’t seem
to understand, but said things about father,
who died so long ago, and once or twice she
laughed, but it only made me cry. She didn’t
seem to see me either, and when I spoke
to her it only started her to talk about
something else, so I watched and watched. I
didn’t pray any more. Somehow all the
prayer had left my soul. Just before morning
she got very still, sometimes a rolling sound
would gurgle in her throat, but when I offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Page 74]</span>
her a drink she couldn’t swallow, and then
I called to her—I couldn’t stand it any longer—‘Mother,
mother, speak to me. I have always
loved you, speak to me once,’ and her dear
lips moved and I bent over her, holding my
breath for fear I would not hear, and she
whispered: ‘Lucille—my—pretty—one,’ and
then her eyes opened and her head fell to one
side, but she didn’t see; she was dead—dead
without one word to me, and I loved her so.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Dido Morgan shared her own scant dinner
with Maggie that day, and the unhappy girl
remained at work that she might earn some
money, which would help towards burying her
mother.</p>

<p>That afternoon foreman Flint came in,
and, nailing a paper to the elevator shaft, told
the girls to read it, saying he’d teach them to
disobey another time, and that next week they
would work harder for their money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Page 75]</span></p>

<p>In fear and trembling the girls crowded
timidly about the shaft to read what new
misery the foreman had in store for them.
They instinctively felt it was a reduction, and
the first glance proved their fears were not
unfounded.</p>

<p>Some of the girls began to cry, and Dido,
the bravest and strongest, spoke excitedly to
them of the injustice done them. Even now
they were working for less than other factories
were paying.</p>

<p>“There is surely justice for girls as well as
men somewhere in the world, if we only
demand it,” she cried, encouragingly. “Let us
demand our rights. We will all go down, and
I will tell the proprietor that we cannot live
under this new reduction. If he promises us
the old prices, we will return to work. If he
refuses, we will strike.”</p>

<p>The braver girls heartily joined the scheme,
and the weaker ones naturally fell in, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Page 76]</span>
knowing what else to do under the circumstances,
and frightened at their own boldness.</p>

<p>Dido Morgan, taking little Margaret Williams
by the hand, naturally headed the line,
and the girls quietly marched after her, two
by two, down the almost perpendicular stairs.</p>

<p>Dido stopped before the ground-glass door
on the first floor, on which was inscribed:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;text-align: center;margin-left: 40%;margin-right: 40%; ">

	</li>
	<li style="border-left: dotted;border-right: dotted;border-bottom: dotted;font-size: .9em; ">
		PRIVATE.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Her heart beat very quickly, but clasping
Maggie’s hand closer, she opened the door
and entered.</p>

		CHAPTER V.<br>
		<small>THE FAILURE OF THE STRIKE.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>Tolman Bike was engaged in conversation
with foreman Flint when Dido opened the
door and entered.</p>

<p>He lifted his head, and never noticing
Dido, fixed a look of absolute horror on Maggie
Williams’s tear-stained and swollen face, as
he rose pale and trembling and gasped in a
husky tone:</p>

<p>“Why do you come to me?”</p>

<p>Margaret gazed stupidly at him with her
small, grey eyes, offering no reply.</p>

<p>Dido, greatly astonished at Mr. Bike’s
manner, stammered out that she represented
the girls he employed, who had decided to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Page 78]</span>
appeal to him not to enforce the proposed
reduction, as they were already working for
less than other factories were paying.</p>

<p>When she began to speak a strange look
of relief passed over his face and with a peculiar,
nervous laugh, he sat down again.</p>

<p>“Get out of this,” said he roughly. “If
you don’t like my prices leave them for those
who do.”</p>

<p>Turning his back to the girls he coolly
began arranging the papers on his desk.</p>

<p>When Dido began to plead for justice he
calmly ordered foreman Flint to “remove
these young persons.”</p>

<p>“If you do dare touch me, I’ll kill you!”
exclaimed Dido in a rage, as Flint made a
movement to obey orders.</p>

<p>He cowered, stepped back and stammered
an excuse to his employer. He felt the scorch in
Dido’s blazing midnight eyes and he respected
her warning and his own person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Page 79]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bike moved quietly to the door and
holding it open, said:</p>

<p>“My beauty, you be careful, or that fine
spirit of yours will get you into trouble some
of these days.”</p>

<p>Dido gave him a scornful glance as she and
Maggie walked out, and the door was closed
behind them.</p>

<p>She related her failure to the waiting girls,
and they all went home after promising to be
there Monday morning to prevent others taking
their places. They seemed to feel the
consequence of their own act less than Dido
and rather welcomed an extra holiday.</p>

<p>That evening Dido pawned all her furniture
and extra clothes, and the money she
received for them, added to her savings, went
towards saving the body of Mrs. Williams
from the Potter’s Field. There was not quite
enough to pay the undertaker, so Dido was
forced to borrow the remainder from Blind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Page 80]</span>
Gilbert, the beggar, who occupied the room in
the rear of that occupied by the Williamses.</p>

<p>Monday morning the girls all gathered
around the entrance to the factory and urged
the new girls, who came in answer to an advertisement,
not to apply for work and thereby
injure their chances of making the strike successful.</p>

<p>Only the foreigners stubbornly refused the
girls’ request, and they applied for and received
the work which the others had abandoned.
Tuesday more foreigners were given work,
and the weaker strikers, getting frightened at
this, quitted their companions and returned to
the factory.</p>

<p>This so enraged the other strikers that
they waited for the deserters in the evening,
when they were going home from work. They
first tried to persuade their weaker companions
to reconsider their decision and somehow the
argument ended in a fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Page 81]</span></p>

<p>Dido Morgan, who was stationed as a
picket further down the street, came rushing
up to the struggling, pulling, crying girls,
hoping to pacify them.</p>

<p>Almost instantly foreman Flint arrived, accompanied
by an officer. Pointing out Dido,
with a diabolical grin he told the officer to
arrest her. The now frightened girls fell back
while the officer dragged Dido away, despite
her protests.</p>

<p>That night she spent in the station-house,
and in the morning she was taken to the
Essex Market Court, where the Judge, listening
to the policeman’s highly imaginative
story, asked her what she had to say, and
though she endeavored to tell the truth,
hustled her off with “ten days or ten dollars.”</p>

<p>Being penniless she was sent to the Island,
where she spent the most miserable ten days
of her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Page 82]</span></p>

<p>But her final release brought her no happiness
or joy. She knew that it was useless
to return to her bare rooms, because of the
rent being overdue, and she had no friend but
Margaret Williams, who had as much as she
could manage to provide for herself.</p>

<p>Disheartened, penniless and hungry, she
spent the day wandering around from one
place to another, begging for any kind of
work. At every place they complained of
having more workers than they needed.</p>

<p>Night came on and she thought of the
Christian homes, ostensibly asylums for such
unfortunate beings as herself. She applied to
several along Second Avenue and Bleecker
Street, but she found no refuge in any. They
were either filled, or because she had no professed
religion and had long since quit attending
church, they barricaded their Christian (?)
quarters against her.</p>

<p>The last and only place, in which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Page 83]</span>
made no inquiries about religion, they
charged twenty cents for a bed, and so the
weary, hungry girl was forced again to go out
into the darkness.</p>

<p>She noticed an open door, leading to a dispensary,
on Fourth Avenue, and hiding herself
in a dark corner of the hallway there, she
spent the night.</p>

<p>In the morning she got a glass of milk and
a cup of broth in the diet kitchen, and then
she resumed her search for work.</p>

<p>It was useless. Tired out and discouraged
she wandered on and on, until she came to
the Park. The unhappy girl sought the enticing
shade, where she watched the gay,
merry people who passed before her. The
more she saw, the more despondent she became.
They looked so blest, so happy.</p>

<p>Life gave them everything and gave her
nothing.</p>

<p>It began to grow dark, and every one hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Page 84]</span>
from the Park. She had no place to go,
no one to care for her, nothing to live for, and
she walked further into the Park, helpless,
hopeless.</p>

<p>How grand it would be to rest for evermore!</p>

<p>The thought came and charmed her.
How sweet, how blessed a long, easy, senseless
slumber would be with no pain, no unhappiness,
no hunger!</p>

<p>She noticed the reservoir, she climbed up
and looked in. Like a bed of velvet the dark
waters lay quietly before her, and the rough
darkness of the surrounding country seemed
to warn her to partake of what was within her
reach.</p>

<p>A great wave of peace welled up in her
heart, her weariness disappeared in an exquisite
languor, which enwrapped her body and
mind.</p>

<p>“‘Rest, everlasting rest,’ rang soothingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Page 85]</span>
in my ears,” said Dido, in conclusion, “and
with a little cry of joy I went to plunge
in”——</p>

<p>“And I saved you from a very rash deed,”
broke in Dick. “My poor girl, don’t you
know there are hundreds of noble-hearted
people in New York who are always ready to
help the unfortunate? There is charity and
Christianity in some places.”</p>

<p>“But they are hard to find,” said the girl,
“and they do not exist in so-called benevolent
homes.”</p>

<p>“Now, I tell you what we will do,” said
Dick, cordially, lighting a match and looking
at his watch. “We will first try to find something
to eat, for I am beastly hungry, and then
I will take you to your friend, Maggie Williams,
if you will kindly show the way, and we
will see what can be done for a young woman
who gives up so easily.”</p>

<p>To be frank, Richard doubted the girl’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Page 86]</span>
story. Yet he did not want to act hastily in
the matter. If the girl had suffered all she
said, he felt that not only would he gladly help
her, but Penelope would be delighted to make
life brighter for the poor victim of fate. So
he decided to take her to the home of Margaret
Williams, if such a person really existed,
and learn from others the true story, if what
she had told him should prove to be false.</p>

<p>In this Richard showed himself very wise
for a young man. If it was really a case of
charity no one would be kinder or more liberal,
but he doubted.</p>

		CHAPTER VI.<br>
		<small>IS THE GIRL HONEST?</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>In a small oyster-house near the Park they
found something to eat, and Dick also found
that he had saved the life of a remarkably
pretty girl.</p>

<p>At any other time Dick Treadwell would
have scorned to eat dinner—and such a dinner—at
such a place. This night he not only ate,
but enjoyed it. He never noticed the uninviting
appearance of the big, fat German waiter
who had, when they first came in, leaned with
both hands on the table and said briefly, and
with a rising accent, “Beer?”</p>

<p>He slapped his dirty towel over the sticky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Page 88]</span>
circular spots on the table as Richard ordered
dinner from a card that looked as if it had
never served any other purpose than that of
fly-paper.</p>

<p>The waiter went out, after receiving the
order, carefully closing the door after him.
The room was evidently meant for small
parties, for the only thing in it was the table
and four chairs.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think the room is too warm?”
Dick asked, and hardly waiting for his guest’s
reply, he got up and opened wide the door.</p>

<p>The waiter spread a cotton napkin over the
table before Dick and Dido Morgan, and set
some pickles and crackers, and pepper and salt,
and two little bits of butter, the size and
shape of a half dollar, on the table; then he
brought the clams.</p>

<p>This done he went out again, very carefully
closing the door after him. Richard
called to him, but he did not answer, so Dick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Page 89]</span>
got up and opened the door himself. Dido
Morgan looked at him with an innocent, questioning
smile. She had no idea that Dick
could possibly have any other reason for opening
the door, than that it made the room
cooler. When the waiter came in the next
time he closed the door. Richard’s face
flushed angrily as he said sternly:</p>

<p>“I wish that door open. You will please
leave it so.”</p>

<p>The waiter gave an impudent, almost familiar
grin, but the door was open during the rest
of the dinner.</p>

<p>As Dido Morgan sat opposite Dick eating
daintily but appreciatively, the color came into
her dark, creamy cheeks, and her brown eyes
sparkled like the reflection of the sun in a
still, dark pool. Her loose, damp hair, hanging
in little rings about her broad brow and
white throat, was very appealing to the artistic
sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Page 90]</span></p>

<p>And her look—it was so frank, so sincere,
so trusting, and her eyes had such a way of
looking startled, that Dick felt a warmer thrill
of interest invade his soul than he ever
thought possible for any other girl than Penelope.</p>

<p>Before dinner was finished Richard had
called her “Miss Dido,” and “Dido,” and she
had not even thought of resenting it.</p>

<p>There are a great many false ideas that are
forgotten in such moments as these.</p>

<p>The one had seen the other face death,
and a human feeling had for the time swept
all false pretenses and hollow etiquette away.</p>

<p>They drove down to Mulberry Street in a
coupé, and if such a thing was unusual to the
young girl whom Richard rescued, it was well
hidden under a manner of ease that suggested
familiarity.</p>

<p>“There is where Maggie Williams lived,”
she said, as they turned down Mulberry Street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Page 91]</span>
Richard leaned forward, but in the semi-light
got little idea of the appearance of the place.</p>

<p>“She may have gone from there by this
time,” Dido continued, showing a slight hesitation
that threatened to shake Dick’s not
over-strong confidence in her. “She lived
there when I went away, but so many things
happen in such short time among the poor.”</p>

<p>“Don’t stop the driver,” she said, quickly,
as Dick pounded on the glass with the head of
his walking-stick. “Drive on to the corner.
It is such an unusual sight to see a carriage
stop before these houses, that it would likely
attract a crowd, and you don’t want to do
that.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Dick, curiously. When he
could not see her face he liked her less.</p>

<p>“Well, you look so unlike the people who
live in this neighborhood, and if you attract
notice, you might find it a very uncomfortable
place for an elegant young man to be in at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Page 92]</span>
almost midnight,” Dido Morgan said, with a
light laugh; then, taking matters into her own
hands, she opened the door of the coupé, and
called the driver to stop.</p>

<p>Richard had no sooner dismissed the driver
than he regretted it. He again felt the old
mistrust of the strange girl, and recollections
of tales he had read of female trappers and
the original snares they lay for their victims
returned forcibly to his mind.</p>

<p>He felt he was a fool to come here at
night, but he was ashamed to go back now.
The night was warm and the heat had driven
many of the people out of the tenements in
search of a breath of air, and the dark groups
of silent men and women who filled the door-steps
and basement entrances and curbstones,
and the ill-favored people who passed them
offered Dick little hope for succor, if indeed
he was the victim of a plot.</p>

<p>There were no policemen to be seen anywhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Page 93]</span>
although Dick knew the police headquarters
were not far distant.</p>

<p>Quietly he walked beside the girl, who, too,
had grown silent. He scorned to confess his
fears, and he felt a determination to meet
what there might be waiting for him, even if it
be death, before he would weaken and retreat.</p>

<p>The girl entered the doorway of a dark,
dilapidated house, the only doorway which
had no lounger, a fact in itself suspicious to
Dick. He, with many misgivings and a
decided palpitation of the heart, stumbled on
the step as he started to follow.</p>

<p>Had he done right and was he safe in
trusting and following this clever girl?</p>

<p>Before he had time to decide she caught
his hand and led him into the dark hall.</p>

<p>A little weak thought, that doubtless holding
his hand was part of the plan to give him
less chance for self-defense, flashed through
his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Page 94]</span></p>

<p>Gropingly he put forth his other hand, and
a thrill of horror shot through him like an
electric shock as it came in contact with a
man’s coat and a warm, yielding body.</p>

</div>


<p>“Did you run against something?” asked
Dido, as she felt Richard start.</p>

<p>“It’s only me,” said a deep bass voice,
which had such an honest and harmless ring,
that Richard’s fear and nervousness dropped
from him like a cloak.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” Dido responded cheerfully,
as she stopped and knocked on a door.</p>

<p>Dick knew it was a door from the sound,
but he was unable to distinguish door from
wall in the darkness.</p>

<p>It was opened by some one inside. Dick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Page 96]</span>
saw the outlines of a girlish figure between
himself and the light, and heard a surprised
exclamation: “Why, Dido!”</p>

<p>They stepped in, and the girl closed the
door and hastened to set chairs for her visitors.</p>

<p>“Mr. Treadwell, this is Margaret Williams,”
said Dido; then turning to Maggie she
added, simply, “Mr. Treadwell has been kind
to me.”</p>

<p>“We were frightened about you,” Maggie
said, her eyes beaming warmly on Dido. “I
heard you got in trouble ’round at the shop.
I went out to look you up, but I couldn’t find
out anything about you either at the station-house
or at your house.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose you know,” she added, “that the
girls went in? Yes, the strike is off. They
wouldn’t take me back, so I’m doing what I
can for Blind Gilbert, and he pays rent and
buys what we eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Page 97]</span></p>

<p>Dido, in a few simple words, frankly told
Maggie all that had befallen her since her
arrest. She did not omit her rash attempt to
commit suicide, and Richard’s timely intervention.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Richard had taken a glance
about the little bare room.</p>

<p>A plain, single-board table, covered with a
bit of badly worn oilcloth, had been pulled out
into the room, and they now sat around it.
A little low oil lamp, with a broken chimney—which
had been patched with a scrap of
paper—was the only light in the room. Dick
carefully slipped a paper bill under the newspaper
which lay on the table where Margaret
had flung it when she came to open the door
for them.</p>

<p>A small stove stood close to the wall, and
on it was a tin coffee-pot and an iron tea-kettle
with a broken spout.</p>

<p>Above the stove was a little shelf, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Page 98]</span>
held some tallow candles in a jar, and some
upturned flat-irons.</p>

<p>The bed looked very unsafe and uncomfortable.
It was covered with a gayly colored
calico patchwork quilt. The patchwork was
made in some set pattern, which was unlike
anything Richard had ever seen or dreamed
of.</p>

<p>Several pieces of as many carpets lay on
the floor, and a much worn blanket was hung
on two nails over the window, to take the place
of a shade or curtain.</p>

<p>Dick’s heart ached at the evident signs of
poverty, and a warm instinct of protection
possessed him.</p>

<p>“I hope you will allow me to be of some
assistance to you,” he said, when the girls,
having finished their confessions, became
silent. “I think I can, in a few days, assure
Miss Dido of a better position than the one
she has lost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Page 99]</span></p>

<p>As he spoke, there came a timid knock on
the door, and Maggie sprang to open it.</p>

<p>“I jest thought I’d drop in tew see how
you wuz gettin’ along, Maggie,” said from
the darkness the same deep bass voice that
had restored Richard’s courage in the hallway.</p>

<p>It was followed by a tall, lank man, who
awkwardly held a black, soft felt hat in his
big red hands. His rough clothes seemed to
hang on him, and he held one shoulder higher
than the other in an apologetic manner, as if
to assure the world that his towering above
the average height of people was neither his
fault nor desire. His bushy and unattractive
dust-colored hair seemed determined to
maintain the stiffness which its owner lacked.
His red mustache and chin-whiskers were
resolved to out-bristle his hair. His shaggy
eyebrows overhung modest blue eyes that
looked as if they fain would draw beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Page 100]</span>
those brows as a turtle draws its head under
its shell.</p>

<p>He bashfully greeted Dido, and she
introduced him to Richard as “Mr. Martin
Shanks, who boards with some friends upstairs.”
He held out his big hand to Dick,
saying:</p>

<p>“Glad to make yer acquaintance, sir!” all
the while blushing vividly.</p>

<p>“We ran against you in the hall, I think,”
ventured Dido.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was standin’ there when you came,”
he answered, slowly, shooting a glance from
under his brows at Maggie.</p>

<p>Maggie looked down, and Dido was surprised
to see her blush. She would have
been more surprised if Maggie had told her
that this great, big, hulking man had stood
guard at her door every night since her mother
died.</p>

<p>“I should jedge you don’t belong to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Page 101]</span>
yer neighborhood,” he remarked to Richard,
shooting forth a jealous look.</p>

<p>“You are correct,” replied Richard, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“What might yer business be?” he demanded
further, nervously turning his hat.</p>

<p>“Down here, or my professional employment?”
asked Richard, waking up.</p>

<p>“What do ye do fer a livin?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see. I’m a lawyer,” Dick replied,
glibly.</p>

<p>“A lawyer, eh? An’ I take it as yer not a
married man, else ye wouldn’t be payin’ attentions
to this ’ere orphan girl.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” Maggie interrupted,
startled. “Dido was in trouble and
Mr. Treadwell found her and brought her
here.”</p>

<p>“Martin should mind his own business,”
exclaimed Dido, indignantly. “If this was my
house I would show him the door.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Page 102]</span></p>

<p>“Not on my account,” interposed Dick,
warmly. “If Mr. Shanks is a friend of the
family he has a right to know the reason of a
stranger being here.”</p>

<p>“These young girls ’ere, sir,” explained
frightened Martin Shanks, “have no parints
to take care on them, an’ I says to meself,
when Mis’ Williams wuz a lyin’ dead here,
that I’d see no harm come aninst them while
I wuz about.”</p>

<p>“That was very good of you, Mr. Shanks,”
cordially replied Dick, and then, bidding the
girls good night, he left. Martin Shanks,
wishing to see the stranger well out of the
neighborhood before he quit his post of
guardianship for the remainder of the night,
accompanied Dick as far as Broadway, and
Dick was not sorry to have his escort.</p>

		CHAPTER VIII.<br>
		<small>THE MISSING STENOGRAPHER.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>When next Richard went to Mulberry
Street, it was to notify Dido Morgan of a
position he had secured for her with a prominent
photographer. Her duties would be
light and not unpleasant, as she was merely
required to take charge of the reception room.</p>

<p>Dido was delighted; nothing could have
suited her better. Before her father died, she
had devoted a great deal of time and study to
sketching, and now this work seemed as
though it might lead her nearer to her old
life.</p>

<p>While Richard was talking to the girls he
heard a scraping noise in the hall, and presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Page 104]</span>
the door opened, and an old man, with
such a decided roundness of the shoulders that
it was almost a hump, felt with his cane the
way before him and apparently finding everything
all right entered and closed the door.
A little, short-tailed, spotted dog, with a world
of affection bound up in his black-and-white
hide, slid in beside the man’s uncertain legs,
and now stood wiggling his body with a
wiggle that bespoke affection for the man.</p>

<p>“Maggie, is you ready for me and Fritz?”
he asked, timidly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Gilbert,” she replied, gently, and she
went to him and guided his uncertain feet to a
chair which stood before the table.</p>

<p>“The young gentleman who was so good
to Dido is here,” she explained, and he lifted
his head quickly as if he would like to see.
At this, Richard very thoughtfully came forward
and taking the old man’s shaking hand,
gave it a warm pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Page 105]</span></p>

<p>“I’m glad to know you, sir,” Blind Gilbert
said, deferentially. “May be you know me,
sir. It’s sixteen years this coming August
since I’ve had a stand on Broadway. I don’t
do much business, but I’m thankful for all I
have. The Lord, in all this mercy, seen fit to
afflict me, but he never let old Gilbert starve.”</p>

<p>“How did you lose your sight?” Richard
asked awkwardly, not wishing to express any
opinion concerning the mercy of making a
man blind.</p>

<p>“Well, it came very sudden like. I had a
little shop in this very room, sir, and I lived
in the one back, where I’ve lived ever since I
lost my shop. I done a good business, as I
had done ever since me and me old woman
came out from Ireland, these forty years ago.
Me old woman fell sick and after running up a
long doctor bill, she died, the Lord bless her
soul, for if we had our fights, she was a good woman
to me. One mornin’ after she had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Page 106]</span>
put in her grave, I started out to go across
Mulberry Street. The sun was shinin’ bright
when I started out the door and it was as fine
a mornin’ as I ever seen. When I got to the
middle of the street, everything got as dark as
night and I yelled for help. They took me to
the doctor’s but he said I had gone blind and
nothing could help me. Then they took me
to a hospital, and after a while I could see
some light with one eye, but then it left and
they said nothing could be done. I couldn’t
stay shut up, so I came back. Me little shop
was gone and everything I owned, so I got a
license and went on to Broadway and begged
until I got enough to rent the back room
again and there I’ve lived ever since.”</p>

<p>“Does what you get pay all your expenses?”
Richard asked.</p>

<p>“The city gives me forty dollars a year, and
I manage to make enough with that to keep me.”</p>

<p>Maggie took a newspaper off the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Page 107]</span>
which disclosed beneath it the table spread for
a simple meal. She took a bit of fried steak
and some fried potatoes from the oven and set
them before Gilbert.</p>

<p>Richard felt somewhat embarrassed and
started to leave, but they all urged him so
warmly to stay that he sat down again. When
Maggie poured out Gilbert’s coffee, she offered
a cup of it to Dick. He, fearing to hurt her
feelings by refusing to partake of what she
had made, accepted the great thick cup. It
was the worst dose Dick ever took. He tried
to maintain an air of enjoyment, but he found
it impossible to prevent his face drawing very
stiff and grave when he tried to swallow the
horrible stuff.</p>

<p>“Won’t you have some more coffee?
This is warmer,” Maggie asked, as Dick at
last set the cup down.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he answered, thickly, but most
decidedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Page 108]</span></p>

<p>Maggie gave him a startled, inquiring look,
and poor Richard felt himself blush as he
endeavored to swallow the mouthful of coffee-grains
he got with the last of the coffee.
Finding this unpleasant as well as impracticable,
he disposed of them as best he could in his
handkerchief and hastened to reassure her.</p>

<p>“I never, never drink coffee until after
dinner,” he said, earnestly, “and only broke
my usual rule on this occasion because you
made it.”</p>

<p>He gave her a smile with this pretty
speech; while it was not exactly what his
pleased smiles usually were, it made Maggie
blush with pleasure.</p>

<p>The spotted dog, having swallowed his
food after the manner of people at railway
stations, came rubbing and sniffling around
Richard’s knee in a very friendly spirit.</p>

<p>“Fine dog, sir, Fritz is,” Blind Gilbert
said, hearing the dog’s sounds. “Gettin’ old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Page 109]</span>
though, like the old man. Now, Mag’, child,—she’s
me ’dopted daughter, sir, I never had
no children of me own—if you’re ready, me
girl, we’ll start for me place of business.”</p>

<p>Maggie put on her hat and fastened a
chain to Fritz’s collar, and then giving Richard
a little smile, took blind Gilbert by the hand
and led him out.</p>

<p>“Maggie is very wretched about her sister
Lucille,” said Dido, confidentially, when left
alone with Dick. “She went away two weeks
before Mrs. Williams died, and she hasn’t
come back yet.”</p>

<p>“Did she say that she would be away for
any time?” Richard asked, with a show of
interest that he was far from feeling. He was
rather weary of troublesome girls just then.</p>

<p>“No, that’s it,” eagerly. “They hadn’t
any idea that she wasn’t coming home.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Where had she gone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Page 110]</span></p>

<p>“They don’t even know that. She said
she was going out to do some extra work.”</p>

<p>“What kind of work?”</p>

<p>“She was a typewriter and a stenographer,”
Dido explained, “and in the evenings she
used to get extra work. This night she went
to work, but she did not come back, and
Maggie worries over it.”</p>

<p>“I should think she would,” Richard replied
kindly. “Why didn’t Maggie go to her
sister’s employer? Probably he could throw
some light on the subject.”</p>

<p>“She did go to him, and he said Lucille
had asked for two weeks’ vacation, which he
had given her, and Maggie didn’t want to tell
him that Lucille had gone out to do some extra
work, for fear he wouldn’t like it. He paid
her by the week, and didn’t know she did
outside work. Maggie thought then she
would be back, but now it is five weeks and
she hasn’t come back yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Page 111]</span></p>

<p>“And poor mother loved her so,” added
Maggie huskily, as she re-entered the room,
having left Blind Gilbert on his corner.</p>

<p>“Do you think we could do anything towards
finding her?” Dido asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“I hardly see what you could do, unless
you notify the police and advertise for her,”
Dick replied, listlessly. He had enough girls
on his mind now, with Penelope, the Park
Mystery girl and Dido, and he did not feel
anxious to add another to his already too
large list. He felt satisfied to look after
Penelope, and was desirous of assuming sole
charge of her, but did not want any more.</p>

<p>“I should say that she had received a
better position somewhere, and that you will
hear from her before long,” Dick added, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, she would surely send for her
clothes if she had,” Dido said, earnestly.
“If you will tell us what to do—what is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Page 112]</span>
best thing—we will try to do it; Maggie is so
anxious to find her.”</p>

<p>“I can easily do for you all that can be
done,” Dick replied. “If you can give me a
description of her, I will send it to Police
Headquarters and have them search for her.”</p>

<p>“She was slender, and had a lovely white
complexion and blue eyes, and black hair,”
Dido began, Richard writing it in a little notebook.</p>

<p>“Was she tall or short?” he asked, pausing
for a reply.</p>

<p>“About my height—don’t you think so,
Maggie? I’m five feet four and one-half
inches.”</p>

<p>“How was she dressed?”</p>

<p>“She had on her black alpaca dress, and
wore a round black turban, with a bunch of
green grass on the back of it,” said Dido.</p>

<p>“And she carried her light jacket along to
wear home, ’cause mother thought it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Page 113]</span>
cold,” Maggie said, helping Dido along.
“Lucille always had nicer dresses than I
had. She was twenty-one, though she didn’t
look it. I am older than she is.”</p>

		CHAPTER IX.<br>
		<small>THE STRANGER AT THE BAR.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>Richard Treadwell sent a description of
Maggie Williams’ missing sister to the police
authorities, and also inserted a cautious but
alluring personal in all the leading newspapers;
still the missing Lucille did not
return, and nothing was heard of her.</p>

<p>“My God, what it is to be poor!” Richard
mused one morning as he walked up Broadway.
“Why, the glimpses I get during my
visits to Mulberry Street, of the trials and
privations the poor endure, makes me heartsick.
There’s Gilbert, blind and helpless,
forced to spend his time on a Broadway corner
begging his living. Sitting there waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Page 115]</span>
for people to give him pennies, and yet he
doesn’t want to die. Why, he clings to life as
if he had the wealth of Monte Cristo. And
all those untidy, unhappy women down there,
with peevish, crying, dirty children, live on in
their garrets and cellars, for what?</p>

<p>“They have no pleasures, no happiness,
no comfort, and they are raising families to
live out the same miserable existence. Ugh!</p>

<p>“And there are Maggie and Dido! They
live in that miserable, God-forsaken room, and
haven’t a decent-looking dress to their backs.
There are no drives, no jewels, no pretty
dresses, no fond petting for them, yet, bless
their brave hearts, they are more cheerful than
most girls I know who live on the Avenue.
Dido is happy now that she has work, and
Maggie would be happy if it wasn’t for her
absent sister. By Jove, I respect those girls.
I admire their spirit, and if I don’t find
Maggie’s sister it won’t be my fault. It’s just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Page 116]</span>
as easy to solve the mystery of two girls, as it
is to solve the mystery of one,” he thought,
with grim humor, as he had made no progress
in either case.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least doubt that Maggie’s
sister, tiring of the poverty at home, found
snugger quarters and is sticking to them. If I
only knew what she looked like I would likely
run across her in some of my rounds. New
York is a very little place to those that go
about. I’ll wager if I knew that girl, and she
was running around, I’d meet her inside of
three evenings. If I could only identify
her——By Jove! I have it. I’ll get Dido,
who knows the girl, and I’ll take her to the
places where we are likely to meet the missing
sister. Whew! Why didn’t I think of it
before? If I don’t know all about her inside
of a week I’ll think—well, I’ll find the little
scamp, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Delighted with his new scheme, Richard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Page 117]</span>
cut across Twenty-fourth Street and went into
the Hoffman House bar-room. Without stopping
he went through to the office, where he
wrote and sent a note to Dido, asking her to
take dinner with him that evening. Then he
walked back to the bar to congratulate himself—after
the manner of his sex—for taking
the road, whose way, he thought, led to
success.</p>

<p>Richard stood before the famous bar and
marvelled how daylight seemed to rob the
room of half its fascination. The men of the
world, the men of fashion, the outlandish
youth of dudedom, the be-diamonded actor
and bejewelled men whose modes of life
would ill bear investigation, had all fled with
the night.</p>

<p>The Flemish tapestry looked dull, and the
exquisite Eve was a less glaring white, and
seemed to have lost expression in a newfound
modesty, and the nymphs and satyr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Page 118]</span>
looked dull and tired. How different from
the hours when the gas brought beautiful colors
into the cut-glass pendants on the chandeliers,
and everything seemed awake and alive
where now they slept. The bartenders
looked dull and uninterested, and a man who
stood alone at the bar drank as if he had nothing
else to do.</p>

<p>He was a low, heavy-set man, dressed
handsomely. He wore a black beard and
mustache, and his small, black, bright eyes
critically surveyed, across his high nose, the
handsome and genial Richard. He set down
an empty whiskey glass from which he had
just been drinking, and, after taking a swallow
of ice water, he remarked, in a voice perfectly
void of emotion:</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but do you know that
you are being ‘shadowed’?”</p>

<p>“I knew they were after me some days
ago, but I thought they had given me up,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Page 119]</span>
Dick said, laughingly. “What do you know
about it?”</p>

<p>“I saw a man dog after you to the office
when you first went through, and when you
returned he came after you and went on out
the side door. He’ll be on the watch for you
when you go out,” he continued, in that even,
passionless voice.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” Dick said, gratefully,
“to warn me of the fellow.”</p>

<p>“The game was too easy, if you didn’t
know,” he said, with a malicious grin. “I only
wanted to give the fellow some work—make
him earn his money. You can both work at
the same game now.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” Dick repeated,
mechanically. He had a faint impression that
the stranger had warned him of his followers
more with malicious motives than with any
feeling of good will, still the next moment he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Page 120]</span>
felt ashamed of harboring such a thought
against the man.</p>

<p>“If you care to know the fellow, I’ll walk
out with you and point him out,” the man
offered gruffly, still with a gleam in his eyes
which showed that the expected discomfort of
the two men afforded him if not exactly pleasure,
at least, amusement.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Won’t you join me first?”
asked Dick. “What will you have? Whiskey”—to
the bartender. “I am very much
obliged for your kindness, and if I can ever be
of any service to you, command me,” and the
impulsive Dick took his card case from his
pocket and handed one of the rectangular bits
of pasteboard to the man just as they both
lifted their glasses.</p>

<p>The stranger glanced at the name and
turned ghastly pale. His glass fell from his
nerveless fingers to the floor with a crash, and
he leaned heavily against the mahogany bar.</p>

		<small>TOLMAN BIKE.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>One evening Mr. Richard Treadwell found
the following letter awaiting him when he
went to his rooms to dress for dinner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“Washington, <i>June Third</i>, 18—.
</p>
<p>
“Dear Dick:
</p>

<p>“I am glad to say our prolonged visit
has drawn to a close, and to-morrow we return
to dear old New York and—Dick. I wonder
how much we have been missed. You cannot
imagine how anxious I am to see you. I feel
sure that you are ready to tell me all about
the poor dead girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Page 122]</span></p>

<p>“You can’t imagine how I feel about her.
Auntie says I am morbid and depressed.
When I go to bed at night and close my eyes
I can see her again lying before us, her masses
of golden hair, her pretty little hands, her
delicate clothes, and I can’t go to sleep for
wondering whose darling she was and how she
came to stray so far away from home and that
they never found her.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe she eloped with some
rascal who tired of her at last and murdered
her to free himself.</p>

<p>“When will you solve this unhappy
mystery?</p>

<p>“Your short, unsatisfactory letters, I have
felt all along, were a mere blind to keep me
from suspecting the surprising story you have
in reserve for me.</p>

<p>“If you have been wasting your time in
being devoted to some of the many girls who
used to attract your attention, and neglecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Page 123]</span>
the Park mystery case, I feel that I can never
forgive you.</p>

<p>“I forgot to tell you in my last that we
met Clara Chamberlain and her mother here.
They came over for a day to arrange with
their lawyers something about Clara’s Washington
property. Clara confessed to me that
the report which was published awhile ago
concerning her engagement was true. You
remember none of us credited it at the time.
Well, it is true, and the wedding is to be
celebrated privately on the seventh. Auntie
is to go and I promised Clara I would be
there. Will this not be rather a blow to your
friend Chauncey Osborne?</p>

<p>“Her fiancé, I believe, is quite unknown
in our set. You know how very peculiar dear
Clara always was! She, of course, says that
he is charming and a man of culture and
ability, a prominent politician and bound to
make a stir in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Page 124]</span></p>

<p>“Auntie met an old friend here, Mr.
Schuyler, who went to school with auntie.
They have been living their school-days over
again—it seems they were boy and girl lovers—and
to hear them laugh over the things
they used to do makes me laugh from very
sympathy.</p>

<p>“Do you know, girls don’t have half the
fun now that they did in auntie’s day. I will
never be able, when I get to be an old woman,
to sit down and recall with a playmate the
funny scrapes we got into when we were
children. When I hear auntie and Mr.
Schuyler talk, I feel so sorry that my life has
been so common-place.</p>

<p>“But there—I have written four times as
much as you did in your last. Mr. Schuyler
is going over to New York with us, and we
are going to show him about. He has not
been there since he was a boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Page 125]</span></p>

<p>“Hoping you have been a good boy during
my absence, I am,</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-right: 2em;margin-bottom: .1em ">
“Very sincerely your (s),
</p>

<p class="right" style="margin-right: 1em;margin-top: .1em; ">
“<span class="smcap">Penelope</span>.”<br>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>“I forgot to say that Clara’s fianceé, I
have been told, is the sole proprietor of some
kind of a factory downtown which assures him
quite a nice income. His name is Tolman
Bike. Did you ever hear of him?”</p>
</div>

<p>“The name sounds familiar to me,”
thought Dick, as he folded the letter and put
it in his pocket. “Still I do not remember
ever knowing such a person. Probably I recollect
it, from reading that notice of Clara’s
engagement, although I had forgotten the whole
matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Page 126]</span></p>

<p>Dick Treadwell was not feeling very easy.
He longed for Penelope’s return, yet he
dreaded it, knowing that he had no progress
to report in the task she had imposed upon
him. He had thought she would be pleased
with his conduct in regard to Dido Morgan
and Maggie Williams, but when she had
expressed a hope that he had not been devoting
himself to girls and wasting the time that
belonged to the work he had undertaken, he
felt a little dubious as to the way in which she
would receive any account of the part he took
with the poor girls whom he wished to befriend.</p>

<p>“Isn’t the matter of likes and dislikes a
strange thing?” Dick asked, when, an hour
later, he and Dido Morgan were dining
together. He refilled the glasses which stood
by their plates. “This is very good wine,
don’t you think? Let me help you to some
spaghetti. I have often wondered why at first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Page 127]</span>
meeting we conceive a regard for some people
and a dislike for others.</p>

<p>“You remember the incident I related to
you the first, or rather the second time you
dined with me, of the man I met in the Hoffman
House who warned me that I was
shadowed. Well, I have run across him several
times since. I have the strangest feeling
for him, and he apparently dislikes me. I
can’t say that I like him, but I have such a
desire to be with and near him that I can’t
say I dislike him either. By Jove, I was
surprised when he fell against the bar that
day and looked so miserably ill. I thought
at first it was the sight of my name that
affected him, but he assured me that it was
a spasm of the heart, a chronic complaint of
his.”</p>

<p>“What was his name?” asked Dido, breaking
off a bit of bread. She was growing prettier
every day since Richard had secured a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Page 128]</span>
position for her, and to-night she was bewitching
in a new gray cloth gown.</p>

<p>“Clark, he said; I think I asked him for
it,” said Dick, laughing.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to have tired of going
around to all sorts of restaurants,” he continued,
noticing the happy expression on Dido’s
pretty face.</p>

<p>“Tired of it!”</p>

<p>Her tone but faintly expressed what
untold happiness those evenings had been to
her.</p>

<p>“I thought you would be disgusted with
our search before it was half finished,” he said,
looking admiringly into her soft brown eyes
that had given him one of those startled
glances which half bewitched him.</p>

<p>“It has been heaven!” she said, with a
sigh of rapture. “I love the bright lights,
and the well-dressed, happy people, and the
busy, silent waiters, and the white linen and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Page 129]</span>
the fine dishes. Oh, I think people who can
take their dinners out all the time must be
very, very happy.”</p>

<p>“You would not think so if you were a
poor, forlorn man,” he said, smiling at her
enthusiasm, “and had to dine out three hundred
and sixty-five times a year, not counting
breakfast and luncheon. I’ve started
out evenings and I’ve stopped on Broadway
and wondered where on earth I should eat.
Delmonico’s, St. James, Hoffman, all are old
stories, clear down the list. Here I had
luncheon, there probably I had breakfast, the
other place I dined last night or the night
before, and at last I turn down some cross
street, and go into a cheap place where a fellow
can’t get a mouthful that it doesn’t gag
him, so I’ll have an appetite to-morrow. I
hate the sight of a bill of fare and I get so
that I’ll fool around for half an hour until
some man near me orders, and then I order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Page 130]</span>
the same thing. I tell you it’s dreadful not to
know where to eat.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is the reason some men
marry?” she asked, brightly.</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly,” he said, flushing
slightly.</p>

<p>“Do the people you see in the restaurants
never interest you?” Dido asked, seeing he
had become silent.</p>

<p>“No, I never notice them unless it is
some one with loud dress or manners, and then
I watch them as I watch a lot of monkeys in a
cage.”</p>

<p>“Every place I go I see some one interesting,”
Dido said, slowly. “Look at that fat
woman over there, in the cherry-red dress and
hat. See how proud that little dark man
looks of having such a woman with him. I
have heard her tell him of her former great
triumphs as an actress, and I can imagine a
story of her life. See that slender, pretty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Page 131]</span>
dark-eyed girl, with very white brow, and very
red cheeks, and very dark shadows about her
eyes, and very, very golden hair. See her
smile and talk to that insipid-looking man,
with an enormous nose and bald head and eye-glasses,
whose ‘villain’s mustache,’ carries
a sample of everything he had for dinner.
Now can’t you picture that pretty girl is some
ballet girl ambitious to rise. He, a man of
means and influence, and she forgets his looks
and that he talks through his nose, and tries
to impress him with her ability.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said Richard, giving Dido a
strange smile. “I’m afraid my imagination
is not as great or as charitable as yours.
Tell me what you think of the party to our
left.”</p>

<p>“That poor little man without legs?”
asked Dido, quick tears coming to her eyes.
“He has a bright, happy face though, and he
has diamonds—many of them, on his fingers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Page 132]</span>
I think that large woman who sits beside him
and looks into his eyes so affectionately, loves
him very much because of his affliction. I’m
sure I would. And that man and woman
opposite, though I don’t like their looks, seem
to heed every word he says and to be very
fond of him.”</p>

<p>Richard laughed softly.</p>

<p>“Well, Dido, I don’t want to spoil your
dream, but that little man has a brain that is far
out of proportion to his weak and dwarfed body.
He stands at the head of his profession, and
has accumulated wealth by his industry and
ability. Quite a reproach to us worthless
fellows, who were born with legs. I have a
great admiration for him, but those people
with him neither care for him for his ability or
his affliction. They are not of that kind.”</p>

<p>“What then?” asked Dido, in distress.</p>

<p>“Money—money, child. It’s the story
you could read at almost every table here.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Page 133]</span>
That’s why I don’t allow my imagination any
liberty in restaurants. Your eyes have not
yet tried the worldly glasses which experience
has put on mine. And now, while we drink
our coffee, let us talk about Maggie’s sister.”</p>

<p>A girl came through, trying to sell some
badly assorted flowers, and a black and yellow
bird in a cage, high above their heads, thrusts
his long beak and head through the wires and,
impudently twisting his head to see what was
taking place below him, gave vent at intervals
to a shrill, defiant cry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Richard lighted a cigarette and
resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>“I think it is useless to hunt for Maggie’s
sister any longer. We have made a pretty
thorough search of the resorts where I thought
we were likely to meet her. I confess I am
disappointed. I was sure we would run across
her somewhere, and that you would recognize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Page 134]</span>
her. Do you think it is possible for you not
to recognize her?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed! I’d recognize Lucille Williams
anywhere,” Dido replied, earnestly.</p>

<p>“My private opinion—don’t tell Maggie—is,
that she tired of her family and home and
that she took herself to better quarters and
means to keep them in ignorance of her whereabouts,
fearing they would ask her to give
towards their support.”</p>

<p>“I hardly think Lucille was as heartless as
that,” thoughtfully replied Dido. “She was
vain and fond of dressing, but I don’t think
she would be as mean as that.”</p>

<p>“What were her habits?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Habits? What she did regularly?
Well, she used to go to Coney Island and
Rockaway and such places in the Summer, with
some boys she met in the places she worked,
but after she got work in the office at the factory
where we worked, she got very steady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Page 135]</span>
and she wouldn’t go out with anybody any
more. The nights she went out she went to
do extra work.”</p>

<p>“How did she get along with your employer?
You gave me the impression that he
was very brutal,” Dick said, musingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lucille got along splendidly with
him. I always thought he was horrible, but
she never said anything about him. She was
very easy-natured, anyway, and I have a bad
temper,” said Dido, in a shamefaced way.</p>

<p>“How did he like her, do you know?”</p>

<p>“Who? Tolman Bike?” asked Dido,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Tolman Bike? Why”—stammered
Dick.</p>

<p>“He was the proprietor, you know, and
Lucille was his stenographer,” exclaimed Dido.
“I don’t know what he thought of her, for
Lucille didn’t talk much; but she seemed to
get along well enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Page 136]</span></p>

<p>Dido became silent, as Richard was intent
on his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Tolman Bike was the name of the man who
was to marry Clara Chamberlain.</p>

<p>Tolman Bike was also the name of the
employer of Lucille and Maggie Williams and
Dido Morgan.</p>

<p>Tolman Bike, Miss Chamberlain’s fianceé,
was the proprietor of a downtown factory, so
it must be one and the same man.</p>

<p>Well, and if so, could it be possible that
Tolman Bike, the man who was engaged to
marry a banker’s daughter, could have been
in love with Lucille Williams, a poor stenographer,
and persuaded her to leave her home
for him?</p>

<p>Richard was a young man, and the idea
was not a surprising one to him. According
to what he could learn, the dark-haired stenographer
was fond of the things she could little
afford to possess, and it was likely that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Page 137]</span>
employer, knowing her desires, made it possible
for her to gratify them.</p>

<p>Now that he was to marry, he would not
be likely to hold out any inducement for the
girl to stay with him, and if they should happen
across her now it was possible that she
would gladly return to the humble home of
her sister.</p>

<p>Still, supposing Tolman Bike had found
no attraction for him in the stenographer?
It was a very delicate thing to handle, considering
that Richard’s knowledge was mostly
supposition.</p>

<p>“Do you think that Maggie’s sister really
worked those nights she was away from
home?” Dick asked Dido.</p>

<p>“She always brought extra money home,
which proved she did,” Dido replied positively.</p>

<p>“Did she ever talk about Tolman Bike?”</p>

<p>“Never, except when she mentioned that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Page 138]</span>
he had dictated more work than usual, or something
of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe that Tolman Bike can tell
me something about Maggie’s sister,” Richard
said. Dido looked at him with a smile of
doubt. “If she is not with him, he can tell
me who she is with, and that is just as well.
I must see him immediately. I have no time
to lose, for three days from to-morrow he is to
be married.”</p>

		CHAPTER XI.<br>
		<small>WHO WAS THE MAN THAT BOUGHT THE GOWN?</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>But Tolman Bike was not easily found.</p>

<p>Richard Treadwell got up early and went
to the box factory, only to be told that Mr.
Bike, suffering from ill-health, had gone out of
the city for a time.</p>

<p>The people in charge of the shop either
feigned ignorance or did not know when he
was to return, but Dick knew, in view of Mr.
Bike’s approaching marriage, on the evening
of the 7th, that he could not be absent from
the city more than two days at the very most.</p>

<p>But one thing he determined on. He
would see Tolman Bike before his marriage to
Miss Chamberlain, and for Maggie Williams’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Page 140]</span>
sake he would know the whereabouts of her
sister. And also for Maggie’s sake would he
do what he could for the sister to induce her
to return to her home.</p>

<p>In the meantime Richard intended to make
an extra effort to learn something about the
Park mystery girl.</p>

<p>He drove to the Morgue, and after some
persuasion he got the bundle of clothes the
pretty dead girl had worn when found in the
Park.</p>

<p>He took the gloves and gown and left the
remaining articles with the keeper.</p>

<p>He decided from the appearance of the
dress that it had been made at some expensive
establishment. He further decided that he
would make a round of the fashionable dressmaking
places and see if some one in them
would not be able to recognize the work.</p>

<p>If they recognized the work, tracing the
owner home should be very easy, he thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Page 141]</span></p>

<p>He took the gloves also, but like the dress,
they had no mark that would assist him in his
search.</p>

<p>After trying several glove stores he abandoned
this as impracticable, for no one claimed
the gloves as having been bought from them,
and even if they had known the gloves were
from their stock, it would have been impossible
to tell who bought them.</p>

<p>Carefully he made a tour of the fashionable
dressmakers. He felt dreadfully embarrassed
as he entered the different establishments with
the large parcel in his arms. The women in
waiting, as well as the women customers,
looked at him curiously, and when he asked,
in a hesitating way, to see the proprietor or
the forewoman, he could hardly endure the
amused smiles of those who were eagerly listening
to hear him state his business.</p>

<p>He thought all sorts of things which made
him uncomfortable. First, the idea came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Page 142]</span>
him that they would think he had brought a
dress to be made to wear in amateur theatricals,
or at a masquerade. But that was not
half as bad as to imagine they thought he had
a wife who was displeased with a dress which
she had returned by him.</p>

<p>The worst part of all was, when he showed
the crumpled gown to the persons in charge
and inquired if they had made it, to have them
first show surprise at the unusual proceeding,
then quiet indignation when they found that
if Richard had a secret concerning the gown
he meant to keep it, and when he guarded
well his reasons for such a strange visit they
bowed him out with such an air of injured
dignity that Richard felt very small and
unhappy.</p>

<p>There were a few that instead of assuming
an injured air, laughed at Richard, and one
familiarly asked him if his wife refused to tell
where she got it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Page 143]</span></p>

<p>The majority of the dressmakers denied
the gown so emphatically that Richard began
to have a dim idea that the workmanship was
not so fine as had been thought and that the
dress had come from a humbler shop. He,
not being a woman, did not know that one
dressmaker never saw any good in another
dressmaker’s work.</p>

<p>When he reached the last establishment of
any note and importance it was almost dinner
time. There were no customers about, and
the employees were making preparations for
closing the shop. A girl came forward and
politely asked Richard his business.</p>

<p>He told her he wished to see whoever had
charge of the place. Requesting him to be
seated she left soon to return with a man.</p>

<p>Richard felt more comfortable than he had
all day. He explained to the man, who listened
kindly and politely, showing neither
surprise nor curiosity, that he wished to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Page 144]</span>
the persons who had made the gown he had
with him, in order to find out who had paid for
the dress and where it had been delivered.</p>

<p>The man took the gown and went to the
workroom. Later he returned and went inside
the small office.</p>

<p>Richard waited impatiently, and for the
first time a hope of solving the mystery of
Central Park entered his heart. Surely when
the man took so much time he had discovered
something.</p>

<p>Still Richard tried to keep his expectations
from running away, lest he be compelled to
suffer a severe disappointment; so when the
man came towards him with the crumpled
gown flung across his arm Richard offered the
consolation to himself that he had still left
for his inquiry the less fashionable dressmakers.</p>

<p>“The dress was made here,” the man said.
Dick’s pulse started off at a two-minute gait.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Page 145]</span>
“A letter was sent here containing an
order for a dress. The measurements were
inclosed and with them over half the price of
the dress in bills. The letter stated that the
person for whom it was intended was out of
town, and that in ten days the dress would be
called for.</p>

<p>“We often have customers order dresses
from a distance,” the man continued, “and we
make them from measure. Ten days afterwards
a messenger boy came in with an order
for us to receipt for the price of the dress and
a $100 bill, from which I took the rest of the
price and gave him the dress and the change.”</p>

<p>“Have you the letter that was sent you
with the measurements and order?” asked
Richard, with a calmness that covered his
excitement.</p>

<p>“No. The boy said he must have the
letter containing the measurements, and I sent
up to the forewoman in the workroom. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Page 146]</span>
had transferred the order to her book, but
had the letter pinned to the same page, so she
sent it down and I gave it to the messenger.”</p>

<p>“Have you not even the name and address
of the person who ordered the dress?” asked
Dick, very much cast down by the turn things
had taken.</p>

<p>“The name we have—it was Miss L. W.
Smith—but there was no address. It was an
unusual thing for us to do, but as I told you,
we have many customers who send us orders
for dresses when they are away from town,
and ladies are not always careful and exact
about addresses. They are liable to fall into
the error of thinking that if we have once
made a garment for them, by merely signing
their name we are sure to recall their address
and histories. We keep very satisfactory
books, which contain little histories of every
garment we make, so we always refer to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Page 147]</span>
when a lady forgets to write us as much as is
necessary for us to know.”</p>

<p>“Had you ever made a dress for Miss
Smith before?” Dick asked, still a faint hope
stirring his pulses.</p>

<p>“We thought so, but on consulting our
books found the measurements showed that one
was for a large woman and the other woman
must have been slender.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is absurd to ask if you have
any idea of where the messenger was from,”
Dick said, rather faintly.</p>

<p>“I do not know, of course, but there is a
messenger office on the block above, where
you might inquire. It is almost useless,
though, for the lady doubtless got the boy in
her district, and as you are aware, this is not a
district of residences. Still, you would not
lose anything by asking. They may be able
to offer you some assistance. I can give you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Page 148]</span>
the date the boy called for the gown and I am
very sorry I cannot do more for you.”</p>

<p>The man had the gown put in a box for
Richard, who left the establishment feeling
happier than he had since he and Penelope
had found the dead girl. He was on the track
of her identity at last, and, though it was a
faint clue he possessed, he felt it a very sure
one.</p>

<p>They did not show much inclination to
help Richard at the District Telegraph office.
At first they said it was impossible to tell
which messenger it was, even if he had been
from that place, and then, after a fashion, they
did make a search, but with no success.</p>

<p>“I know it,” said one of the messengers,
who was standing at the counter. “I had
stopped out front to scrap with Reddy Ryan,
who was takin’ a basket of clothes home, and
a duffer drove up in a carriage and asked if I’d
do a job for him, ’n I told him I’d been sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Page 149]</span>
on a call, so he said he’d give me a dime if I’d
run an’ get him a messenger. I came, an’
Shorty, No. 313, was sent out. I remember it
’cause he told me the man just sent him into
Moscowitz’s to get a dress an’ pay a bill, an’
gave him a dollar for doin’ it.”</p>

<p>“Where is No. 313?” asked Dick, his
spirits rising fifty per cent.</p>

<p>“He’s off on a call. No, here he is,” said
the messenger who knew something. “Come
here, Shorty, you’re wanted.”</p>

<p>Shorty was a red-headed boy with a
freckled face and one eye. The other messenger
recalled the circumstances to him, and
he sniffed his nose and said he remembered.</p>

<p>Richard then asked if there was a lady in
the carriage, but No. 313 thought not. Then
Richard asked him what the man looked like,
but No. 313 could not say, except that he had
a mustache and wore a soft felt hat. No.
313 had no opinion as to whether the carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Page 150]</span>
was private or hired, but he “guessed” it
wasn’t a livery hack, “cause the harness
jingled.”</p>

<p>The other and brighter messenger said the
man was young, denied the soft felt hat and
pronounced the carriage a hired one.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Richard hurried through his dinner,
possessed of an unusual feeling of happiness,
and went for Dido Morgan to spend their last
evening in their peculiar search for Maggie’s
sister.</p>

<p>To-morrow Penelope would be home, and
he had learned something. If ever so little,
still it was something, and now that he had
made such a successful start he began to feel
hopeful of a final success. He knew now
where the dress had been made and he knew
a man had called for it. He had engaged the
two messenger boys, and with them he intended
to search the town over for the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Page 151]</span>
who got the dress which the dead girl had
worn. Once he found the man, then the rest
would be easy.</p>

<p>Richard took Dido to the Eden Musée,
and after she had seen all the figures that
interested her, Dick took her up to the cosy
retreat above the orchestra, where the tall
green palms cut off the glare of the electric
light. He ordered some ice cream for Dido
and some Culmbacher for himself, and lighting
a cigarette he gave himself up to the influence
of the beautiful Hungarian music and
dreams of Penelope.</p>

<p>The music sobbed and sighed, and Dick
drifted on dream-clouds and was lazily happy.
He would solve the mystery, he felt sure, and
then what years of happiness with Penelope
stretched before him. What a great thing it
was to be happy; life is so short, why should
people allow themselves to be unhappy for a
second if they can possibly avoid it? An unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Page 152]</span>
tenderness filled his heart, a peaceful
happiness stole over him, making him very gentle.</p>

<p>And poor little Dido, how dreary life
loomed up before her! Dick’s heart swelled
with pity, and he sympathetically took the
girl’s hand in his and looked tenderly into
the soft, brown eyes that looked at him so
trustingly.</p>

<p>There was so much happiness and love in
waiting for him and Penelope, but what did
life offer to poor, lonely Dido?</p>

<p>And as the sobbing music ended in one
long thrill, Richard, raising his eyes from the
richly tinted face of this sweet girl companion,
saw standing before him, with white face and
stern eyes—</p>

<p>Penelope.</p>

		<small>ONE AND THE SAME.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>At the sight of Penelope Richard was
dumbfounded.</p>

<p>He stifled a first impulse to spring to his
feet and greet her when he saw her stern,
white and reproachful face, and sitting still
tried slyly to drop Dido’s hand.</p>

<p>With an almost imperceptible bow of
recognition, Penelope went on after her aunt
and a gentleman who, unnoticed, had in
advance passed Dick and his companion.</p>

<p>“D—— it!” said Dick, warmly, in an
undertone, and then he thought: “I’m in for
it now. Penelope will never believe that
thinking of my love for her made me feel a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Page 154]</span>
great pity for this lonely girl. She will say I
was making love to her, because I held her
hand, and she will never forgive it. What an
ass I am to risk a life-time of happiness with
Penelope, just to sympathize with a girl whose
life is lonely, and yet, poor little devil—It’s
all up with Penelope, I know. I can tell by the
look on her face that she will not forgive or
believe me. I’ll give up. It’s no use now
trying to solve the Park mystery—no use
trying to do anything.”</p>

<p>Dido looked uneasy. She had seen all
and she partly understood. She said, in a
little strained voice: “I am very sorry.”</p>

<p>“I wish some man would tramp on my
toes or punch me in the ribs. I’d just like a
chance to knock the life out of somebody,”
Dick said, savagely.</p>

<p>Dido laughed softly at Dick’s outburst, but
she delicately avoided the subject of the lady
who looked so angry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Page 155]</span></p>

<p>“I forgot to tell you,” she said, at length,
in an effort to change the subject, “that it’s
all arranged at last.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Dick, curiously, the current
of his thoughts leading him to think it
was something about Penelope.</p>

<p>“Why, the affair between Maggie and
Martin Shanks. Why, didn’t you know?” in
great surprise. “Why, I saw it all the first
night you brought me back.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice anything in particular, but
I recall plainly feeling Mr. Shanks in the dark,”
Richard replied, grimly. He always felt a little
disgust at the remembrance of his fears that
night, and he cherished a grudge against lanky
Martin Shanks for waiting to be run over in
the hallway.</p>

<p>“Well, Maggie and Martin are in love,”
exultingly.</p>

<p>“Possible!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and last night he proposed and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Page 156]</span>
accepted, and Sunday they are going to be
married, and they are going down to Coney
Island to spend the first day of their honeymoon,”
and Dido sighed in ecstasy.</p>

<p>“Lucky Martin, I’m sure; I wish I were
in a like position,” Dick said, half enviously,
as the sad thought came that it was all over
between him and Penelope. “I must get a nice
present for Maggie.”</p>

<p>“It was all so amusing,” said Dido, with a
rippling laugh. “I’m half sorry the courtship
ended so soon. Martin was so faithful, so
bashful, and so desperately in love. The only
time he ever showed the least spirit was the
night you took me home.”</p>

<p>“I remember it quite well,” Dick said,
drily.</p>

<p>“I thought he was very insulting that
night, but it’s just his way, you know. He has
liked you ever since then. You know he
always stood guard in the hall; every night I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Page 157]</span>
was out, I would stumble over him, yet he
couldn’t be coaxed to come in. When Maggie
took Blind Gilbert out to his stand,
Martin always followed, so as to protect her
coming home. Still, if she looked at him or
spoke to him, he was so embarrassed that he
couldn’t answer.”</p>

<p>“He gave her some flowers once, and
when she thanked him, he was so broke up
that he stammered that he had found them on
Broadway and thought she might as well have
them, and the great simpleton had bought
them expressly for her. Next he bought some
cloth for a dress, and when Maggie said she
couldn’t take it, he said he didn’t want it, that
he couldn’t make any use of it. Just fancy
Martin Shanks wearing a dress!”</p>

<p>Richard smiled at the picture presented to
his mind of lanky Mr. Shanks in a gown.</p>

<p>“His proposal was the funniest thing,”
Dido continued, with a chuckle. “There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Page 158]</span>
came a loud knock on the door. Maggie
opened it, and there before her was a work-basket.
She picked it up and lifted the lid
and there lay a plain gold ring.”</p>

<p>“Martin,” she said, going out to where he
was standing in the hall, “you are too good to
me. I can’t take these things.”</p>

<p>“I had an idee you’d let the parson, who
brings us tracts, put that there ring on yer finger,
and then you’d have the right to do me
mendin’. It was an idee, maybe I’m wrong?”</p>

<p>“‘Then Maggie said gently, ‘Come in,
Martin,’ and he replied, ‘If yu air wid me,
Maggie?’ and she blushed, and said, ‘Yes,
Martin,’ and he stepped into the room, saying,
‘I’ll come in to settle accounts.’</p>

<p>“When he went out again all arrangements
had been made for a speedy marriage. Martin
said it was no use to waste time in being
engaged, so they are to be married Sunday.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Page 159]</span>
They are the happiest couple you ever saw,”
and Dido sighed enviously.</p>

<p>“And what is to become of you and blind
Gilbert? Are you to have no share in their
Eden?” Richard asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Maggie says they are going to
rent a flat further uptown, and one room is to
be for me and Lucille when she comes back,
and Gilbert is to stay with them also. It’s a
pretty big family to begin with, but we’ll all
give what we can to pay expenses. I don’t
think Gilbert will go, though. He likes Maggie
as though she was his daughter, but he’s
been so many years in that house on Mulberry
Street that I don’t think he will leave it.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is our last evening to search
for Maggie’s sister,” Richard said, with half
regret, “and we have had no success whatever.
I’m sorry, for Maggie’s sake, though personally
I feel it is just as well for her if her sister
never returns to be a burden on her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Page 160]</span></p>

<p>“I intend to see Tolman Bike before his
marriage and learn from him where the sister is.
Then, if we think it advisable, we can still persuade
her to go home, but I have another important
matter that will take all my time, so I
cannot do much, for a while, at least, about
Maggie’s sister, unless Bike tells me where she
is when I see him, as I intend to do to-morrow.
I expect to be too busy working on
an important case to see you for a while, but I
hope your good luck will still continue, and you
can congratulate Mr. Shanks and Maggie for
me.”</p>

<p>“It is useless for me to try to thank you
for your kindness and help to me,” Dido said,
brokenly.</p>

<p>Dick’s blue eyes beamed kindly on Dido as
he replied, quickly: “There’s a good girl,
don’t let us talk about that. I’m a useless fellow,
and if I have been of the least service to
any one, the gratitude is all on my side. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Page 161]</span>
grateful to you for allowing me to imagine I
have been of service to you.”</p>

<p>“You have been better to me than any one
on earth,” she said, vehemently, her eyes burning
into his. “You have often said there was
no gratitude in the world, so I won’t say I
would like to prove my gratitude to you, but
some day—I’ll wait. The day will come when
I can show you what I feel.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” he said, softly, his eyes
moist, for he was much touched by the girl’s
words, “only be happy and that knowledge
will make me happier.”</p>

<p>Dido looked down and was silent. Presently
two tears chased each other down over
her cheeks and splashed on her slender hands,
folded pathetically in her lap.</p>

<p>“Why, Dido, child!” Dick said, startled.</p>

<p>She raised her brown eyes, wet with tears,
to his frank blue ones, and her lips were
quivering pitifully. He took her hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Page 162]</span>
patting them soothingly, not daring to say a
word.</p>

<p>“T-they <em>would</em> come,” she faltered, her
mouth bravely smiling while her eyes were
filling with tears. “I—I could not help it.”</p>

<p>He still said nothing, but kept on patting
her hands, half embarrassed now.</p>

<p>“I was so—so wretched until you found
me, and I’ve been so happy since, that—that I
couldn’t quite bear—your words.”</p>

<p>“I hope I did not speak roughly,” poor,
blind Dick said, hardly understanding her
grief. In his separation from her he was
losing nothing, but she—poor child—she was
losing everything.</p>

<p>“No—that’s it. You are so kind,” she
faltered. “Don’t, please, don’t mind me. I am
so foolish. I am always crying, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>She looked up at him with a sad, little
smile that made his heart ache, he hardly
knew why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Page 163]</span></p>

<p>“Will you promise me something, Dido?”
he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, simply.</p>

<p>“Promise that you will try to be happy;
that you will never cherish blue thoughts, no
difference what happens. Let ill-luck frown
on you all it wishes. Laugh at it; laugh in it’s
face until your laughter makes it smile.
Promise me to do this?”</p>

<p>“Is that what you do?” she asked, evasively.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know. But what difference!
I don’t get as low in spirits as you do. Won’t
you promise?”</p>

<p>“You have brought me happiness. I
promise if I get blue to think of you. Will
that do?” she asked, seriously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said, half provoked,
but he urged no further.</p>

<p>And these two young people, whose barks
had floated side by side on the stream of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Page 164]</span>
for a brief time, were drifting apart. Mentally
they were taking farewell, for they knew
that, if even for a few days, they remained yet
in sight or call, still their course lay so widely
apart that they might never hope to float near
each other again.</p>

<p>So they silently left the place where they
had spent their last evening together and went
out on the street into the cool quiet night.</p>

<p>A few gas jets dimly lighted up Twenty-third
Street, and the stores that lined the opposite
side frowned dark and gloomy upon the
few people who occasionally made their appearance
as they walked from the darkness into
the light of the street lamps, and then disappeared
again into the shadows beyond.</p>

<p>Coming towards the young couple from
Sixth Avenue was a man, thoughtfully walking
along, as if, unable to sleep, he had sought the
quiet streets to think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Page 165]</span></p>

<p>Richard noticed him, and pressing Dido’s
arm, he whispered:</p>

<p>“Look at this man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she said, excitedly.</p>

<p>The men exchanged glances, and the stranger
raised his hat stiffly in response to Richard’s
cordial greeting. After they had passed,
Richard said:</p>

<p>“Why do you tremble so? I merely
wanted to call your attention to him. That is
Mr. Clarke, the gentleman I had the experience
with in the Hoffman House bar.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Clarke!” cried Dido, in amazement.
“<em>Why that is Tolman Bike!</em>”</p>

		CHAPTER XIII.<br>
		<small>A LOVERS’ QUARREL.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<p>“Why!” as if unpleasantly surprised at his
visit, “how do you do?”</p>

<p>Such was Penelope Howard’s greeting to
Richard Treadwell the morning following the
meeting in the Eden Musée. He could not
stay away from her, so he decided to try to
explain all about Dido. He wished now he
had not been so anxious to keep the affair a
secret until Penelope’s return. It made things
look all the blacker for him.</p>

<p>Penelope was a clever girl. She was bitterly hurt,
but she had no intention of quarreling
with Dick. If she experienced any
jealous pangs he should not have the satisfaction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Page 167]</span>
of knowing it. She would merely
maintain a cold indifference and make him
feel that, do as he pleased, it was nothing to
her. She would smile, but indifferently, and
not with the smile of affection with which she
had always greeted him. She would treat him
in a manner that would show her displeasure
and utter lack of affection for him, but she
would not quarrel and so give him a chance to
offer an apology or explanation.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem very glad to see me?”
Dick ventured, with a forced smile.</p>

<p>Penelope looked with well assumed amazement
and surprise at his audacity, and, raising
her eyebrows, said with a slightly rising
inflection, “No?”</p>

<p>Richard felt very ill at ease.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” he continued,
helplessly. “I hope at least you will allow
me to explain the scene which you witnessed
last night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Page 168]</span></p>

<p>She said, with a cold smile: “Really, you
must excuse me. I have no right or desire to
know anything about your personal affairs.”</p>

<p>“Confound it, Penelope. Don’t be so
infernally indifferent,” exclaimed the young
man with exasperation.</p>

<p>She simply looked at him. Scorn and
disdain was pictured on her expressive countenance
now.</p>

<p>“I hope Mrs. Van Brunt is well?” he said
awkwardly, hoping to bridge over Penelope’s
anger.</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you,” looking idly out
the window.</p>

<p>“Is she at home?”</p>

<p>“No; she has just gone out with Mr.
Schuyler,” Penelope replied, picking up a book
and aimlessly turning the leaves.</p>

<p>“I hope I may be permitted to call and
pay my respects to her?” he said, indifferently.</p>

<p>“Auntie will doubtless be pleased to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Page 169]</span>
you,” was the reply, with a marked emphasis
on the noun.</p>

<p>“How long are you going to keep up this
nonsense, Penelope?”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders impatiently
and pouted her lips, but made no reply.</p>

<p>“Do you know you are a very foolish girl
sometimes? You cheat yourself and me out
of happiness. You know down in your heart
you never doubt my faith to you. What
pleasure you get from pretending that you do,
I can’t imagine. Come, be reasonable. Don’t
cultivate a bad temper.”</p>

<p>“Hum! I should not think you would
care what I did if I am unreasonable, bad tempered,
foolish, suspicious—is that all?” mockingly.
“I am glad to know your honest opinion
of me. Doubtless, that cheap looking girl
you were with last night is more amiable.”</p>

<p>“I imagine she is, Penelope,” Dick said,
dejectedly and out of patience. “I have loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Page 170]</span>
you devotedly, and I have meekly endured all
your caprices, and if you want my devotion to
end in this way I can only obey. If you ever
regret it, Penelope, remember it was your own
doing. You sent me away and I shall not
return.”</p>

<p>And Richard, a very wretched young man
indeed, walked hastily from the room.</p>

<p>Penelope never moved until she heard the
hall door close. She thought that he would
come back; he always had, but when she realized
that he had really gone she was surprised
and a little frightened.</p>

<p>Richard was very good-natured, but she felt
she had gone just a little too far, and that if
she wanted him back it would be necessary to
humble herself.</p>

<p>She could not recall a time before that she
had so forgotten herself, and allowed her temper
to take such a hold of her. She could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Page 171]</span>
hardly recall all she had said, but she felt very
small and ungenerous.</p>

<p>Now that she had lost him she reviewed
her own conduct, and felt that, although Richard
had done wrong, she had been unnecessarily
harsh. He deserved some punishment
to teach him not to err again, but she had been
too unforgiving.</p>

<p>Wasn’t Dick always gentle and kind to her,
and did he not always manfully and tenderly
overlook her little mistakes and pettishness?
Besides, was she not sure he loved her better
than any girl in the world? Then why should
she be jealous if he amused himself with those
other women who are always so ready to
“draw men on.”</p>

<p>A woman in love always reproaches herself
with being the cause of every lover’s jar.</p>

<p>A woman in love invariably blames other
women for all the slips made by the man she
loves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Page 172]</span></p>

<p>And they will do it to the end of the
world.</p>

<p>While Penelope was spending the day
racked with unhappy thoughts, Richard was
busy trying to see Tolman Bike and managing
the messenger boys in their search for the man
who paid for the dead girl’s gown.</p>

<p>Richard called at Mr. Bike’s office, only to
be informed that Mr. Bike was still absent
from town. But he knew to the contrary this
time; so, obtaining the address, he called at
Tolman Bike’s bachelor apartments in Washington
Square.</p>

<p>Mr. Bike was in town, this servant said,
but he did not expect him in until it was
time to dress for a 7 o’clock dinner. He did
not know where Mr. Bike was to be found,
so Richard was forced to rest content with
this meagre information until a later hour.</p>

<p>Richard first consulted a directory. He
found quite a list of Smiths, but no Miss L.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Page 173]</span>
W. Smith, and he concluded if nothing more
feasible offered he would select the Smiths
who lived in the best neighborhoods, and personally
visit every family until he found the
right one, or knew positively no such Smith
lived in New York. He had inserted a personal
advertisement in all the morning and
evening newspapers asking for information
concerning the relatives of Miss L. W. Smith,
and he expected by evening to have some definite
clue to work on.</p>

<p>His disagreement with Penelope, instead
of killing all desire to try further to solve the
mystery of Central Park, infused him with new
life and energy, and he was resolved to solve
the mystery, and by doing so, make Penelope
regret her unreasonableness.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the messenger boy, Richard
Treadwell tried his original plan of walking
about to meet people in the busy parts of
the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Page 174]</span></p>

<p>“When you see a man that you think resembles
the man who got the dress, I want
you to tell me,” he instructed the boy, and so
in hopes of knowing at least what the man
looked like, Richard spent the day wearily
travelling around.</p>

<p>“There goes a fellow that looks just like
the other duffer,” the boy announced, as he
and Dick stood watching the passers-by on
Broadway.</p>

<p>Richard started to follow the man who, in
company with a red-headed florid-faced man
that carried about with him one hundred and
fifty pounds of superfluous flesh, was going
down Broadway.</p>

<p>The man pointed out by the boy had a
light beard, a high nose and sharp eyes.
Richard recognized him as an Albany assemblyman.</p>

<p>“That looks totally unlike the man I pictured
from your description,” Richard said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Page 175]</span>
crossly, as they followed the two men into the
Hoffman House.</p>

<p>“Well, his face looks like the other fellow,
only the other one had black whiskers, and
this here one’s is red.”</p>

<p>“Bleached, doubtless,” Dick said ironically.</p>

<p>“Well, he looks the same, anyway,” the
boy protested, as Dick seated himself in the
bar-room and made a pretense of reading a
letter.</p>

<p>The two men went to the bar and ordered
drinks, and as the thinner one (they were
neither on the lean order) raised a glass to his
mouth, Richard started and looked more
closely at him.</p>

<p>Surely his face looked familiar then!</p>

<p>“I am tired; you can go to your office
now and come to me in the morning,” Dick
said to the messenger, who gladly started off.</p>

<p>Richard sat there with serious face watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Page 176]</span>
the man at the bar whom the boy had pointed
out, until he and his heavy companion went
out; then Dick fell into deep thought.</p>

<p>A wild, improbable suspicion had come to
his mind, so improbable, so wild, that he felt
ashamed to dwell on it. The likeness was
familiar; so unlike, and yet so strangely like,
that Dick hardly knew what to believe.</p>

<p>“Poor devil! Why should I allow a
chance resemblance to make me accuse him of
a thing so bad as that. He has enough to
bear and answer for now, yet—yet—But it’s
too wild, too improbable. I’ll forget it, I’ll
dismiss the thought from my mind; the messenger
was surely mistaken, and I’ll devote my
evening to seeing about Maggie’s sister.
Here’s to an evening free from all thoughts of
that dead girl. And yet—it’s very strange—I
half believe”—Then, shrugging his shoulders,
Dick impatiently drained his glass and started
for Washington Square.</p>

	</h2>
</div>


<p>As Richard was early, he stopped for a
moment to see Dido Morgan, and finding her
ready to start home, asked her to walk a little
way with him down Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>She was looking quite wan when he went
in, but she brightened up and flushed with
pleasure at the prospect of seeing him for a
little time.</p>

<p>“I had an offer from a manager to-day to
go on the stage,” she said, quietly.</p>

<p>“I hope you did not accept it,” Dick
replied, quickly, looking at the girl’s downcast
face, which seemed strangely altered since last
night.</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Page 178]</span></p>

<p>“And you won’t, Dido?” he said, pleadingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why not, Mr. Treadwell.”</p>

<p>Dick started unpleasantly. He had not
before noticed that she never called him by
any name when addressing him, and now it
seemed to suggest that there was a difference
between them, and he vainly wondered what it
was.</p>

<p>“I should be very sorry, Dido, to see you
go on the stage. In the first place you don’t
know anything about acting, and it would take
you years before you could hope to attain any
position.”</p>

<p>“I <span class="allsmcap">FEEL</span> that I can act,” she said deeply.
“My nerves seem so tight that I long to get
up and act some life. I want to act love, and
then hate, and then murder.”</p>

<p>“Why, Dido?” Dick asked, coolly and
curiously, although he felt the deep emotion
underlying her words. He recalled what an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Page 179]</span>
old club-man said to him once, that every
woman disappointed in love wanted to act, and
he half wondered if Dido had been falling in
love with some of the handsome men who frequented
photograph galleries to have reproduced
the being they love most of any on
earth, but he put away the thought as a wrong
to Dido.</p>

<p>“I <em>feel</em> it, I tell you I feel it. I can’t
endure a monotonous life any more. I must
have some excitement,” she said, passionately.</p>

<p>“I tell you what you want—exercise! You
want to walk and you want to swing clubs and
you’ll soon be all right. You are so confined
that you have a superfluous energy which your
work does not exhaust. If you spend it on
exercise, it will make you a happier and
stronger girl.”</p>

<p>Dido showed a little resentment. It
always disgusts a woman to have her romantic
feelings dissected in a matter-of-fact manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Page 180]</span>
Having reached Washington Square, she bade
Richard good-bye and went on her way to her
humble home.</p>

<p>Richard walked along North Washington
Square until he came to the house where he
expected to find the man who had taken
Lucille Williams from her home. He went
up one flight of stairs to Tolman Bike’s apartments,
and knocked on the door on which was
tacked Mr. Bike’s visiting card.</p>

<p>In a moment the door was opened, and the
man he knew as Mr. Clarke stood before him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bike,” said Richard, with emphasis
on the name, “I must speak with you alone.”</p>

<p>Richard spoke imperatively and at the
same moment stepped inside.</p>

<p>Mr. Bike looked as ill as the day he fell
against the Hoffman House bar. He silently
motioned Dick to enter the first room leading
off the private hall in which they stood.
Closing and locking the door he followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Page 181]</span></p>

<p>Richard seated himself in an easy chair,
unasked. Mr. Bike sat down before a richly-carved
desk, littered with packages of letters
and photographs, which apparently he had
been engaged in assorting and destroying, for
bundles of them were slowly smouldering in
the open grate.</p>

<p>The room was very handsome, and Richard
viewed it with appreciation. There was
a large open grate and above the low, wide
mantle was a cabinet containing, in the centre,
a French plate mirror, and on the brackets fine
bits of bric-a-brac. The floor was richly
carpeted, the walls were hung with fine paintings,
while near the portieres, draped just far
enough back to give a picturesque perspective
view of a suite of rooms as cosy in the rear,
was an alabaster statue of The Diver and
another of Paul and Virginia.</p>

<p>A Mexican <em>serape</em>, quaintly colored, was
thrown over a low lounge, before which lay a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Page 182]</span>
white fur rug. At one side was a little, square
breakfast table, with curiously turned legs, and
near it a half side-board, half cabinet, attractively
filled with exquisite dishes, a few solid
silver pieces and crystal glasses, backed up by
long-necked bottles of liquids to fill them.</p>

<p>Mr. Bike had removed his coat and waistcoat
and had on a little embroidered jacket.
He did indeed have an unhealthy pallor, and
Dick noticed that the hand with which he
toyed with a carved paper-cutter shook
violently.</p>

<p>“How this man loves life and its good
things,” Dick thought, sympathetically, as his
gaze wandered from one article of luxury to
another, and on to another room, where, just
through the portire, he could see a brass cage,
in which a yellow canary was jumping restlessly
about, and a small aquarium, up through
which came a spraying fountain. He could
even see goldfish swimming about and a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Page 183]</span>
dark turtle run its head out of the water and
then dive down again to the bottom of the
basin.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know why I came to see
you?” Dick said at last, when he saw Mr.
Bike would not introduce any subject.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t say that I do,” Mr. Bike
responded, with affected indifference.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to know all about Lucille
Williams,” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>“What right have you to come to me for
such information?” Mr. Bike asked coldly.</p>

<p>“Because you induced the girl to leave her
home,” Dick replied positively, “and I want
to know all you have to tell about the rest
of it.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to tell,” Mr. Bike said,
with a slight, sarcastic smile.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, if you won’t tell, I’ll find a way
to make you,” Richard said, angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Page 184]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! Indeed!” Mr. Bike ejaculated, still
cool and unconcerned.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; if you don’t tell me what I want
to know before I leave here, I will go to Miss
Chamberlain, your fiancée”—Mr. Bike started
uneasily—“I’ll tell her a story you would not
like her to know.”</p>

<p>“And you flatter yourself that she would
believe you?” sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I know it. I can prove what I have to
say,” Dick replied in a manner that was unmistakable.</p>

<p>“All right, go to her. See what you can
do.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, I will. I will go to the newspapers
too, and I’ll tell them—”</p>

<p>“What?” Mr. Bike asked, rather uneasily.</p>

<p>“You know <em>what</em>! Disabuse your mind
of any idea that I don’t know some chapters in
your life, that, if made public, will end your
devilish career.” Richard hinted darkly, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Page 185]</span>
suspicions which had come to him before that
day sweeping over him with full force.</p>

<p>Tolman Bike was thinking intently.
Richard saw that his last bluff had gone home
and he determined to follow it up with more
of the same kind.</p>

<p>“Be as unconcerned as you please, Mr.
Bike. To-morrow, when your marriage is
postponed, and you are called on to answer
to the serious charge I shall bring against you,
you will be sorry that you didn’t take the easier
course, and give me the information I asked
for.” Dick said this as if his patience had run
out.</p>

<p>“I have no information to give,” Mr. Bike
said, in a tone which showed he was beginning
to weaken.</p>

<p>“Say, it’s wasting time to pretend to me.
Either you will, or you will not, do as I have
asked you. If you don’t, the consequences be
on your own head.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Page 186]</span></p>

<p>“And would you—do you mean—” hesitated
Tolman Bike, losing confidence at sight
of Dick’s undiminished determination.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I mean every word of it.”
Dick had risen and he looked very angry and
capable of doing all the bad things he threatened.
“I have given you a chance, and you
refuse to accept, so—” and he shrugged his
shoulders as if his responsibility ended there.</p>

<p>“And if you get the information, what use
will you make of it?” asked Bike, as if longing
for some hope to be held out to him.</p>

<p>“You know what I want. It is not to
bring any credit to myself, but to relieve the
suspense of a heart-broken sister.”</p>

<p>“And would you, if I tell you all, be man
enough to show some mercy?” he asked, in a
hopeless way.</p>

<p>“I hold out no promises. I am determined
to have a confession from you before your
marriage. If you don’t give it, you don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Page 187]</span>
marry, and you can put that down for a certainty,”
Dick said doggedly.</p>

<p>“And if I tell you,” in sudden hope, “will
you let my marriage go on without telling
Clara? Promise to let us get away on our
wedding tour and then you can do as you
wish. Only give me that much,” almost
pleaded the now trembling man.</p>

<p>“And let you wreck the life of the innocent,
unsuspecting woman who becomes your
bride? What sort of a man do you think I
am?” Richard asked in scorn.</p>

<p>“My God, man! Have some feeling.
Haven’t I suffered enough already? You are
a man, you can understand how a man will
sell his soul to hell for the sake of a woman,”
he said bitterly. “Have some feeling!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you understand it?” he continued,
desperately, in vain effort to wake compassion
in Richard’s breast. “She was pretty, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Page 188]</span>
had no friends to make any trouble about it,
and I lost my head. I have suffered for it.
I have regretted it.” And Tolman Bike put
his hands over his face, and Richard heard a
broken, husky sob.</p>

<p>This was more than he could endure. His
sternness fled at that sound, and he could
hardly refrain from attempting to console the
wretched man. Only thoughts of the poverty-stricken
little sister helped him maintain an air
of unrelenting sternness.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you ask of me?” Richard
asked with a roughness that covered his real
feeling. Now that he had conquered the man
his suspicions fled. He felt sorry for Bike’s
suffering and had a guilty feeling that he was
the cause of it.</p>

<p>“Only give me until to-morrow and I’ll
swear to you that you shall know what you
want to before ten o’clock. Give me until
then. If I fail, you have yet time to stop my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Page 189]</span>
marriage in the evening. You are a man, but
if you won’t spare me for a man’s follies, spare
me for the sake of the woman I am to marry.
I’m sick! I can’t talk! Only give me until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“—— it, Bike,” Richard said, feelingly,
“if it wasn’t for the girl’s sister, I’d fling the
whole thing over.” He little knew what it
meant to him. “I believe your promise. I’m
a man, reckless, indolent, careless as the worst
of them, and, confound it, I’m sorry for you.
There’s my hand.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you,” Bike said, his
deep emotions showing in the painful twitching
of his pale face. He clasped Dick’s firm
hand in his own dry, feverish one, and gave it
a grateful pressure.</p>

<p>“Until to-morrow, then?”</p>

<p>“Until to-morrow,” echoed the unhappy
man, looking into Dick’s face with an appealing
look of agony that Richard never forgot.</p>

		<small>“TO RICHARD TREADWELL, PERSONAL.”</small>
</h2>
</div>


<p>It was ten o’clock when Richard Treadwell
in gown and slippers, sat down in a high-backed
chair to partake of a light breakfast.</p>

<p>The dainty table was spread with its burden
of light rolls and yellow butter, with a bit of
ice on it, and crisp, red berries. The odor of
the coffee was very appetizing, but Richard
ate and read the morning paper at the same
time.</p>

<p>The awnings lowered over the windows
shut out the glare of the morning sun. A
light breeze moved the curtains lazily, and a
green palm on the window-sill waved its long
arms energetically, as if to hurry the indolent
young man who was missing the beauty of
Summer’s early morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Page 191]</span></p>

<p>Richard Treadwell’s rooms were as unlike
the elegant apartments of Tolman Bike, as a
violet is unlike a rose. One, like a laughing,
romping child, denoted health and cheerfulness;
the other, unhealthy in tone and coloring,
spoke of dreams and selfish gratification.</p>

<p>Here were copies of Rosa Bonheur’s
master-pieces of animal life, pictures of racing
horses, photographs of serious-faced dogs in
comical positions, a stuffed fish’s head, with
wide open mouth, mounted on a plaque; boxing
gloves, clubs and dumb-bells, lying where
they had fallen after this young man had taken
a turn at each of them. There was an
unsorted jumble of walking-sticks, whips, fishing
tackle and firearms. The furniture was
light, the curtains were thin and airy, the
carpet was bright and soft.</p>

<p>Richard ate and read unmindful of the
wrestling match between a bow-legged pug
and a saucy black-and-tan, whose little sharp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Page 192]</span>
ears stood stiffly erect, expressive of cool
amusement at the fat pug’s futile attempts to
throw him.</p>

<p>As Richard pushed his chair back and
lighted a cigarette, a man-servant entered
quietly and put a large envelope and a smaller
one on the table before him. Richard took the
larger envelope and read the superscription.</p>

</div>

<p>He hastily tore it open with his thumb.
The letter began without any preliminaries:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In writing this I place my life at your
disposal. I neither expect mercy nor ask it.</p>

<p>I have been so wretched for days that
life is a burden I little care to bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Page 193]</span></p>

<p>Do what you please with this, but if you
possess an unheard-of generosity I would ask
you, after clearing yourself, to spare me as
much as possible.</p>
</div>

<p>“My wild, improbable suspicions were
correct!” Dick exclaimed, in surprise. The
black-and-tan, hearing his voice, came and
jumped inquiringly against his knee, but
receiving no attention returned to finish the
English Kilrain on the rug.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I first met Lucille Williams when she came
to my office in answer to my advertisement
for a typewriter and stenographer. Of the
many who applied I selected her. Not because
she was the most proficient worker, but for a
man’s reason.</p>

<p>She had a pretty face.</p>

<p>Wonderfully pretty, I have had men tell
me. She had large, clear blue eyes and an
abundance of wavy black hair, and a faultless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Page 194]</span>
pink and white complexion that often accompanies
the combination. Her hands were
small and slender. She was particular in the
care of them, and her remarkably small feet
were always well shod.</p>

<p>Life is dull at best during business hours,
so I amused myself with my pretty typewriter.
It started first by my playfully putting
my arm around her chair when dictating.
Harmless enough. Yes, but it brought me so
close to her that I began to wonder what she
would do if I kissed her. When I stopped in
my dictation she raised her great, blue, alluring
eyes to me in such a way, that I wouldn’t have
been a man had I not felt a little thrill of
temptation.</p>

<p>I did kiss her at last.</p>

<p>She was not much offended. She cried a
little and wanted to know what she had done
that encouraged me to insult her. Her chief
fault was vanity, so I pleased myself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Page 195]</span>
comforted her by taking her in my arms and
vowing that the sight of her red lips so close,
and her great eyes, so alluring and entrancing,
was more than I could resist. It comforted
her and pleased me.</p>

<p>Yes, I said something of love.</p>

<p>It somehow seemed the only thing to say
under the circumstances. I think I called her
“My Love,” and similar names. I am positive
I did not say that I loved her, although
I recall coaxing her to say she loved me.</p>

<p>She said she loved me and I believed
her.</p>

<p>It was all very pretty and interesting while
it had the charm of newness. We soon spent
our evenings together. I took her to restaurants
patronized by Bohemia, where, if one
happens across an acquaintance, he, on a similar
errand, is just as anxious to keep it a secret
as you are. In the summer, when there was
less chance of embarrassing meetings, I took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Page 196]</span>
her to better places and occasionally to the
theatre.</p>

<p>I found it interesting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I learned that Lucille’s sister
was employed in the factory, and I threatened
Lucille with an eternal parting if, by any
chance, her family learned of our intimacy.
When the pretence of seeing friends and persons
about business would no longer serve as
a blind, I instructed Lucille to say she was
engaged on extra work. She very sensibly
said she could not do this without money to
show for it, so I promptly made it possible.
Thereafter that was her blind.</p>

<p>Thus she deceived her family.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I thought I would feel more
comfortable if Lucille were better dressed.
You know how men feel on this subject.
Most of them would rather be seen in company
with the lowest woman in New York
if she wore a Paris gown, than with a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Page 197]</span>
in rags, even if she were as pure as a saint.
A man is always afraid of being chaffed for
being with a badly dressed woman.</p>

<p>For the world, looking on, judges only by
the dress.</p>

<p>I spoke to Lucille. I found she was as
sensitive about her cheap garments as I was,
so I told her if she would buy an entire outfit
suitable for our wanderings I would pay for it.
I made suggestions, and the garments she
bought were as lady-like and appropriate
as if it had been an every-day affair with
her.</p>

<p>Then came the question, Where to send
the clothes?</p>

<p>She could not send them home, for her
mother and sister, though poor, had Puritan
ideas concerning morals and propriety.</p>

<p>There is a way out of every difficulty.</p>

<p>I had her send all her new articles to my
bachelor apartment. Then I gave her a key,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Page 198]</span>
so she could enter my rooms at any time to
change her cheap clothing for her new and
vice versa.</p>

<p>So I got her to my rooms.</p>

<p>I don’t deny that it was my intention at
first to finally take her there, but I wanted to
preserve the sentiment of the affair as long as
possible. She was very perfect to the sight,
very lovable, and I was eager for our evenings—anxious
to drip out as slowly as possible
the intoxication of the affair, still breathlessly
eager to drain the cup.</p>

<p>There is no need of going into detail.</p>

<p>You know what bachelor apartments are;
you know what opportunities they afford. Lucille
was timid at first; afraid to come in or go
out, but she soon grew bolder. She even
grew to like the danger of it.</p>

<p>I was very fond of her then.</p>

<p>There is no use to be hypocritical and cry
it was love of her that led me on. Why men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Page 199]</span>
adopt such weak pleas, I never could understand.</p>

<p>It was not love of her.</p>

<p>A man never injures a woman through love
of her, but through love of self. I realized
this all the time, but I was passionately happy,
and happiness is not so plentiful that I should
slight it, result as it might.</p>

<p>I promised to marry her.</p>

<p>It happened in a moment when I loved her
best. I knew at the time, I was doing a reckless
thing. The next day I warned her to
keep our love secret, because there were reasons
why, if it were known, it would be injurious
to me. She, appreciating the difference
between us, was as silent as I could be.</p>

<p>By and by things began to pall.</p>

<p>I was too well acquainted with her. I
grew tired of her pretty face. Her little vulgarities
exasperated me. She was a woman of
such little variety, and she so weakly bowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Page 200]</span>
every demand I made that it became unbearable.</p>

<p>I have known homely women whose charms
were more lasting.</p>

<p>Her weakness maddened me. I grew to
hate her. If she had only had enough spirit
to quarrel with me, but that was the secret of
it; she had no spirit until it was too late.</p>

<p>Just before this I met Miss Chamberlain.
I found that I had pleased her fancy and I
concluded to marry.</p>

<p>It mattered little that I was not in love; I
had long since learned that love was merely
the effect of some pleasing sensation, which
some persons, like some music, produce on us,
that shortly wears itself out.</p>

<p>I thought it better to marry where there
was no feeling than where there was. For the
sensation of love is sure to die, leaving an unsupportable
weariness caused by its own
emotion. Where there is no such feeling,
there is no such result to fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Page 201]</span></p>

<p>I never expected any trouble from Lucille.</p>

<p>But I reckoned without my host. Although
I endeavored to keep my engagement
secret, yet a line to the effect that I was to
marry Miss Chamberlain, reached print. Lucille,
though hardly in society, always read
society notes. She read that one.</p>

<p>She became a tigress—a devil. Isn’t it
queer that a weak woman always has an ungovernable
temper? Expecting nothing more
than a few tears from her, I answered carelessly,
and she grew infuriated. Of course, I was
astonished. She accused me of falseness and
demanded that I deny the report over my own
name and marry her immediately, or she would
seek Miss Chamberlain and lay before her
what she pleased to call my baseness.</p>

<p>I was determined to marry.</p>

<p>It meant wealth, a better social position,
power, and a wife that at least I would be
proud of. I had cherished such an idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Page 202]</span>
marriage since I was a boy, and I was resolved
that nothing should balk me now that it was
in my grasp.</p>

<p>I was determined to take fate into my own
hands.</p>

<p>Finding I could not quiet Lucille, I concluded
to rid myself of all responsibility in her
case.</p>

<p>Call me base if you will!</p>

<p>Was I doing more than hundreds of men
are doing in New York to-day!</p>

<p>Had I done more than hundreds—aye,
thousands—of men have done in New York?</p>

<p>You are a man of education and means;
denounce me if you have never sinned likewise.</p>

<p>Let any New York man of education,
leisure and money denounce me, if any there
are who have not likewise blundered.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of a few days’ amusement,
harmless if it ended quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Page 203]</span></p>

<p>But I slipped up on it—therein lies the sin.
Not in what I did, but in blundering over it.</p>

<p>People may say what they will. I was not
wrong. It is the system that is wrong, the
system that prevents people who care for each
other from being happy in that affection while
it lasts. Had the system been different
Lucille would have been home to-day, happier
and in more comfortable circumstances than
previous to our meeting, and I—I would not
now be writing to you.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to save us.</p>

<p>Tired and disgusted with Lucille, she
further exasperated me with her jealousy and
unreasonable demands for a speedy marriage.
Fearful of losing the marriage which meant so
much to me, I carefully planned what seemed
the only course to pursue.</p>

<p>Yes, it was deliberate.</p>

<p>Calming her anger for the day, I persuaded
her to come to my apartment—these very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Page 204]</span>
rooms where I sit and quietly write this confession
of my crime.</p>

<p>Unsuspecting, aye, even gladly she came—came
to meet her fate, which waited for her
like a spider in his entangling web for a fly.</p>
</div>

<p>“If you please, sir, Miss Howard’s compliments,
and would you come up as soon as
possible,” said a voice at the door.</p>

<p>The little black-and-tan paused for a moment,
with the pug’s ear still between his little
sharp teeth, to see where the voice came from,
and Richard responded, impatiently: “Very
well, say I’ll be there,” and returned to Tolman
Bike’s letter.</p>

		<small>THE MYSTERY SOLVED.</small>
	</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>The mockery of the thing amused me.</p>

<p>I knew so well how it was to end, and
when Lucille came cheerfully to me, never
thinking but that she would return to her
home that night, I laughed aloud.</p>

<p>She wanted to talk about my promise of
marriage, and I readily consented. In very
few words I gave her to understand that it
was impossible for me to marry her in her present
condition, but if she would be guided by
my judgment, and bought suitable clothing, we
could then go away and be quietly married.
To do this it was necessary that she remain
with me.</p>

<p>She was more than satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Page 206]</span></p>

<p>She was elated over her brilliant prospects.
Still she was stubbornly determined to notify
her family, and only by threatening to abandon
the whole affair if it became known did I
keep her from doing so. I did, however, consent
to her writing a note saying she had gone
out of town for a few weeks, and on her return
would have a joyful surprise for them. It
satisfied her and did not hurt me.</p>

<p>The letter was never mailed.</p>

<p>Lucille’s presence was not unknown to
some few. My servant, who slept at home,
knew I had somebody with me, but as he had
served many years in taking care of bachelor
apartments, he was neither surprised nor
inquisitive. The waiters who served our meals
knew I was not alone, but to them, also, it was
a story too old to merit comment. Still I
took precautions that they should not see
Lucille.</p>

<p>In the garments I had bought her I sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Page 207]</span>
Lucille to a dressmakers to get her measurements.
I also sent her to a dentist to have
some decaying teeth filled, and so I started to
work out my release from a woman of whom I
had tired.</p>

<p>You might say that I could have taken a
more simple way. I don’t see how. I was
afraid of losing my wealthy fiancée and so I
would not risk the least chance of Lucille’s
telling. Of course I could have claimed blackmail
and been declared innocent, yet, knowing
the nature of the woman I was hoping to
marry, I would not risk the effect it would
have on her.</p>

<p>There seemed only one thing to do, and I
did it. I had Lucille write an order for a dress,
from my dictation, inclosing the measurements
and stating that it would be called for on a
certain date. Personally I went to different
stores and bought the garments necessary to
make a perfect outfit. I did not spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Page 208]</span>
expense. I brought everything home with me
in the coupé. This relieved me of necessity of
giving any address or name, which made me
feel sure the articles could not be traced to
their destination.</p>

<p>During this time Lucille was very happy,
notwithstanding her imprisonment. She was
constantly planning what she would do when
we were married. She dwelt in delight on the
sensation her marriage would create among
those who knew her. She discussed the localities
most suitable for us to live in, and talked
of things she intended to buy for her house
and the dresses she meant to get.</p>

<p>It is useless to try to describe the emotions
I labored under during those days. I was
conscious of a tiredness, underlaid with a
stolid determination not to be balked in my
purpose. I felt no sympathy for Lucille. I
think I was absolutely without feeling one way
or the other. I only felt a desire to laugh at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Page 209]</span>
her air castles as she told them to me. Not
amused—no. I can’t say what the feeling
was. Even when she lay awake some nights
and I knew she was painting her future, I
laughed aloud at the strangeness of it all.</p>

<p>I counted the nights. Every one found
my preparations nearer completion.</p>

<p>Carefully I removed all trade marks and
names from every garment I had bought her.
The gloves and <em>Suéde</em> shoes only bore their
size. I took the crown lining out of the hat,
and before I brought her dress home I removed
the inside belt, which was stamped with the
name of the man who made it.</p>

<p>The dress was the last article but one I
brought to my apartment. I did not even
show myself at the establishment where the
gown was made. I drove near the place, and,
hiring a messenger boy, sent him in for the
garment. In this way I preserved the secret
of my identity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Page 210]</span></p>

<p>The last thing I bought was a bottle of
hair bleaching fluid. I told Lucille that if her
hair was golden to match her eyes I thought
her appearance would be much improved.
She was quite anxious to make the test, always
being ready to do anything she thought would
increase her beauty. For two days, at different
intervals, I brushed her hair with the fluid,
and it turned the most perfect golden shade
I had ever seen.</p>

<p>It really transformed her. I have since
then marvelled at the change and have felt an
admiration for her perfect beauty. Then I
felt nothing.</p>

<p>I only had a desire to watch her. I
watched her eat and wondered at her appetite.
I listened to her light talk and marvelled at
her happiness. I gazed at her while she slept,
amazed, almost, at her evident sense of
security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Page 211]</span></p>

<p>Why did nothing warn her? I waited and
watched for some sign that would show that
instinct felt the approaching end. There was
no sign.</p>

<p>The last night, I leaned on my elbow and
watched her sleep. She looked so perfect!
Her soft, dimpled arms thrown above her head,
her pretty face in a nest of golden hair, her
straight black brows, her long, black lashes
resting lightly on her pink cheeks, and all to
become nothing—nothing. To-morrow night
it would be over; this was her last night.
Impulsively I leaned over her and whispered
“Lucille! Lucille!” but she merely opened her
great blue eyes, and giving me a little smile,
as innocent and sweet as a babies, moved with
a sigh of perfect content close to my arm,
which rested on the pillow, and so went to
sleep again.</p>

<p>I lay down and tried to still the heavy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Page 212]</span>
painful beating of my heart. I was very
weary, but I could not sleep.</p>

<p>At breakfast something kept saying, “Her
last! her last!” and it gratified me to see her
eat. At luncheon she complained of no appetite,
yet I almost compelled her to eat, while
I ate nothing. During the day I told my
servant to take a holiday, that I would be out
of town and he could have several days to
spend as he wished. Rid of him, I ordered a
dinner fit for a wedding feast; still I could not
eat. Lucille ate and I helped her joyfully. I
had a desire to see her happy. I have thought
the jailer who feasts the condemned prisoner
an hour before the execution must feel as I
felt this day.</p>

<p>Late in the evening I laid her new garments,
the finery that so delighted her, out on
the bed. I laughed when I did it, and then I
sat down and watched her dress. She was as
happy as a child. She put on one thing after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Page 213]</span>
the other, surveying each addition in the mirror
with little cries of delight. I laced her
<em>Suéde</em> shoes and helped fasten her dress and
buttoned her gloves. When all was done I
wrapped her in a gray travelling cloak and hid
her pretty face under a thick veil.</p>

<p>I had told her we would take the midnight
train for Buffalo, where we would be married,
and remain at Niagara for a few days before
our return to New York. She trusted me
in everything, and asked me if she could
increase her wardrobe before the time for our
return. We were to start early enough to
permit us to take a drive before going to the
station. Lucille had been confined so long
in the house that she welcomed this arrangement,
and she was very eager and nervous to
start.</p>

<p>I had ordered my horse and dog-cart to be
ready at a certain hour. I had a liking for
late drives, so my orders were not considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Page 214]</span>
unusual. I walked out of the house, first telling
Lucille to lock the door and walk around
the corner on Fifth Avenue, where I would get
her.</p>

<p>Before starting, however, I asked Lucille
to drink a glass of wine with me. I put in
hers a sleeping potion, and she raised it to
her lips, saying:</p>

<p>“Here’s to our happiness.”</p>

<p>I put my wine down untasted.</p>

<p>Then she came to me in an affectionate
way I had once admired, and raising her veil,
said:</p>

<p>“Tolman, kiss your little one.”</p>

<p>I folded her in my arms. My heart beat
quickly, my breath came painfully. I held her
close to my breast, I kissed her soft, warm,
lips regretfully.</p>

<p>“Lucille,” I said, pleadingly, “will you go
back to your home and forget you wanted to
be my wife?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Page 215]</span></p>

<p>“I would rather die,” she answered me,
angrily.</p>

<p>I knew then it was too late. There was
no way to retreat. Either I must accomplish
my purpose, or renounce all claim to Miss
Chamberlain and take Lucille as my wife.</p>

<p>“We have been very happy these two
weeks, haven’t we, Tolman?” she said, with
her arms about my neck. “Kiss your little
one good-by, for when she comes back here she
will be your wife.”</p>

<p>“Yes, when you come back,” I said, and I
kissed her. With that there flitted through
my mind a picture of a little quiet home with
her as my wife. I thought of her beauty, but
then came the thought that it would cost me
what I most longed for—wealth—position.
No, it was too late.</p>

<p>I drove to the curb almost the instant she
had reached there, and only stopped long
enough to get her in. I had a valise, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Page 216]</span>
Lucille thought contained a change of clothing,
in the dog-cart. I drove off quickly to the
Park.</p>

<p>We had not more than entered the Park
when Lucille yawned and complained of
feeling drowsy. I drove on, listening intently
for any sounds that would indicate the presence
of any one. Reaching a bend in the
road and finding everything still, I asked
Lucille to hold the reins until I could get out
to see if something was not amiss with the
harness.</p>

<p>Drowsily she took the reins.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything coming, Lucille?”
I asked, as I reached under the seat and,
drawing out a sandbag which I had made ready
in advance and concealed there, I rose to my
feet as though to jump out of the buggy.</p>

<p>“No, Tolman; the way looks clear,” she
replied, slowly, as she leaned forward to
look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Page 217]</span></p>

<p>With a swift motion I raised the sandbag
and brought it down on her head.</p>

<p>She never uttered a sound, but fell across
the side of the cart. I caught her with one
hand and, taking the reins from her limp fingers,
steadied the horse.</p>

<p>I took her in my arms to the nearest
bench. I listened for her heart-beats. They
were still. I removed the Connemara cloak
and veil. I had some difficulty, but at last
managed to place her in an upright position
on the bench. Then I folded her hands in
her lap, and as I could not make her parasol
stay on her knee, I left it where it fell on the
ground before her.</p>

<p>I kissed her lips, still warm and soft,
and closing her eyes, pulled her hat down
so it would prevent their opening. Taking
the wrap and veil and putting them and the
sandbag in the valise I drove back to the
stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Page 218]</span></p>

<p>I returned to my rooms and spent the
remainder of the night in destroying all the
clothing which belonged to her. Early in the
morning, just about daybreak, I went quietly
out and to the Gilsey House, where I got a
room and went to bed. I slept. It was
afternoon when I awoke, and while eating my
breakfast I read in the first edition of an evening
paper an account of your finding Lucille’s
body in Central Park.</p>

<p>In the smaller envelope I enclose a photograph
of Lucille taken before her hair was
bleached. You will doubtless recognize it.
I also inclose the letter she wrote to her
mother.</p>

<p>You can understand now why I was frightened
at the sight of Maggie Williams’s tears;
why I was horrified when I met in the Hoffman
House the man who was suspected of
being guilty of my crime. My guilty fears
prevented my giving you my name, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Page 219]</span>
you came to my apartment, seeking Lucille, I
knew that my hour had come.</p>

<p>I might have given you a fight and warded
off the end for a while. But what use. If the
proof was not conclusive enough to hang me,
it was enough to imprison me, for the waiters,
my servant and the livery-man could have
made out a case of circumstantial evidence. I
prefer death.</p>

<p>It is morning. The morning of the day
which was to have been my wedding day. Oh
God, I had some wild hope when I began this
confession. It has gone now. This is all. If
you have any charity in your soul, spare me
all you can.</p>

	</h2>
</div>


<p>Richard could hardly dress quickly enough
after he finished Tolman Bike’s letter. The
indolent young man had never been seen in
such frantic haste. The elevator seemed to
him to creep. Rushing out to the street, he
jumped into the first cab, telling the driver to
make the best possible speed to Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>With a sad, penitent face, Penelope Howard
was impatiently awaiting her handsome
lover in her own little room, her abject apologies
all cut and dried for use. But he gave
her no time.</p>

<p>“Penelope, the mystery is solved!” he
yelled, and catching her in his strong arms, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Page 221]</span>
held her so close to his heart that she gasped
for breath.</p>

<p>“I’ve the story right here, sweetheart,” and
in the fewest possible words, punctuated with
Penelope’s exclamations of surprise and sorrow,
Richard related all that had happened
since the night before she went to Washington.</p>

<p>“My dear—Oh, Richard. Good morning,”
said Penelope’s aunt, as she entered the room
with bonnet on and a carriage-wrap thrown
hastily over a house dress. “Mrs. Chamberlain
has sent for me. They have just received
news that Clara’s fiancée, Mr. Bike, was found
dead in his bathroom, shot through the head.
They think it was accidental, and poor Clara,
who was to have been a bride this evening, is
prostrated. I’ll be back presently, dear. Richard
stay with the child.”</p>

<p>They let her go without a word of the information
they possessed, and, oblivious to all
else, they read Tolman Bike’s confession.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Page 222]</span>
Woman-like, Penelope was in tears, and had as
much pity for the unhappy man as for the
luckless girl.</p>

<p>“I knew he was the man,” Richard said.
“When the messenger boy pointed out the
man in the Hoffman House as looking like the
man who got the gown, the resemblance struck
me, though this man was fair and Tolman Bike
was dark. The moment the resemblance
struck me, the whole thing flashed before my
mind. My ridiculous remark that probably
the man was bleached, suggested to me the
possibility of Maggie’s sister having bleached
after she left home. Still, it was all so wild
and improbable that I tried not to think of it.”</p>

<p>They decided only to tell the secret of the
crime to those most concerned. That done,
they effectually saved the name of Tolman
Bike from deeper disgrace, little as he deserved
it.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Van Brunt returned from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Page 223]</span>
house where the preparations for wedding festivities
had been turned into arrangements for
a funeral, Penelope, with her eyes red from
weeping, drew her aunt into her own little den
where Richard was. Together they told the
astonished woman the story of the crime, and
she was more determined even than they were
that the confession should be held sacred, since
making it public could benefit no one, and
would only serve to hurt the family who had
expected to welcome him into their home as
the husband of the daughter of the house.</p>

<p>They had intended to visit Maggie Williams
that day and tell her the story of her
sister, but Mrs. Van Brunt, more thoughtful,
told them to delay the sad information until
the girl was married, as Richard had told them
of her intended marriage Sunday.</p>

<p>Tolman Bike was privately buried Sunday
from the Chamberlain mansion, while the girl
who was to have been his bride, lay unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Page 224]</span>
in a darkened room upstairs. Mrs. Van
Brunt, as an old and intimate friend of Mrs.
Chamberlain, went to the funeral. Penelope
went with her aunt, her heart divided in sympathy
for the dead man, the dead girl, and the
stricken daughter of the Chamberlain household.
If Tolman Bike had lived, Penelope
would have hated him for his crime, but
because he had strength to die, and when she
pictured his lonely end, she felt sorry for his
wretched fate.</p>

<p>Sunday evening they visited Maggie Williams,
now Mrs. Martin Shanks, and Penelope
gently told them the story of the Mystery of
Central Park, omitting as much as possible
that would pain the sister. Rough, but kindly
Martin Shanks comforted his bride. Dido
Morgan mingled her tears with Maggie’s, but
she was shy and awkward, having little to say
in the presence of Penelope Howard, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Page 225]</span>
Penelope did her utmost to be cordial and considerate.</p>

<p>The warm, frank feeling that had heretofore
existed between Dido and Dick was gone.
Dick endeavored to be friendly and pleasant,
but Dido maintained a stiff silence that made
him have a sense of relief when he and
Penelope finally took their departure.</p>

<p>“Ah, Penelope, it’s true, as Tolman Bike
said, happiness is not so plentiful in life that
we can afford to let it slip by when near our
grasp,” Richard said, sadly, as he and Penelope
drove homeward. Penelope merely sighed in
response.</p>

<p>“I did not solve the mystery as you
expected and wished,” he continued, taking
her hand in his, “still I object to being cheated
of my happiness. When are you going to
marry me?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Penelope tried to say in playful
surprise, but her hand trembled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Page 226]</span></p>

<p>“This is the tenth. I will give you until
the twenty-first to make what little preparations
you need for the wedding,” Richard said,
masterfully, yet tenderly.</p>

<p>“Oh! If you talk that way I suppose I
must meekly obey,” Penelope said, as, with a
sigh of content, she allowed Dick to take her
in his arms.</p>

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
